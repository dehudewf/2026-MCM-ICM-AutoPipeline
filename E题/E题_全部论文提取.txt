【Summary】
----------------------------------------
Carbon neutrality is mainly achieved by reducing carbon emission and increasing carbon
sequestration. Forests have an important impact on enhancing carbon sequestration. In this paper,
we developed a forest system carbon sequestration prediction model and a forest value balance
decision model to study the carbon stock changes of forest system (forest and forest products)
and the optimal management plan, and to reveal the beneficial effects of certain deforestation on
the carbon sequestration of forest system.
In Task1, the change of carbon stock in the forest growth cycle satisfies the logistic law, so
we obtain the deforestation intensity and the age of deforestation when the forest is stable and the
carbon sequestration is maximum. In order to accelerate forest restoration, new trees need to be
planted in the deforested area. Thus, forest system carbon sequestration prediction model is
developed. We explored the effects of deforestation interval and forest size on carbon stock, and
obtained the optimal management scheme. The results show that the optimal forest management
plan is to cut old-growth trees annually, to produce high-lived forest products, to set the cutting
intensity at half the inherent growth rate of forest carbon stocks, and simultaneously to plant both
the cut and increased areas. Under our optimal scenario, Beijing's deforestation is stabilized at
6

3.2 10 m

, and carbon neutrality is achieved around 2063.
In Task2, considering the social demand, economic benefits and ecological influence of
forests, forest value balance decision model is constructed and the balance point between the
values is studied. And we analyze the scope of application of management plans and the
prerequisites for no deforestation. Using genetic algorithms and characteristic parameters of each
forest, we determine the optimal management plans and transition points for forests in different
temperature zones and forests with different uses. The results indicate that our model is mainly
applicable to general forests. Some forests can not be deforested for biodiversity or cultural
reasons. The transition points in optimal management plans of different types of forests are
different, and the transition points can be divided into phased and final. However, all types of
forests can effectively increase or be in a stable state of carbon sequestration while satisfying
social needs under optimal plans.
In Task3, we choose Tien Shan forest as the research object. Based on the above decision
model, we obtain the optimal forest management plan when each value of Tien Shan forest is
balanced, and the change of its carbon stock in the next 100 years. The results show that the
optimal management plan is to carry out annual felling of old trees and produce long life forest
products, and to plant the felled areas. Under the optimal plan, the economic benefits of the Tien
Shan forest stabilize at

【Introduction】
----------------------------------------
1.1 Problem Background 
Climate change has long been recognized by the international community as one 
of the major global environmental issues. Greenhouse gases produced by human activ-
ities, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), have seriously affected the 
chemical composition of the atmosphere. With their strong ability to absorb infrared 
radiation, they have caused the rise both in the average temperature of the earth's sur-
face and in sea level year by year, inducing incalculable damage to mankind. Therefore, 
using forests, especially forest products, to absorb and sequestrate atmospheric carbon 
dioxide is an effective and practical way to reduce greenhouse gases. In a forest eco-
system, the carbon cycle can be divided into four stages [1], as shown in the figure 
below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: The carbon cycle 
 
The first stage is the absorption of carbon dioxide by the forest through photosyn-
thesis. The second stage is tree cutting, where part of it becomes logs to be used for the 
production of HWP (harvested wood products) and the remainder will rot or burn to 
release the organic carbon in it. The third stage is the wood use stage, where the amount 
of carbon sequestered by logs in the production of HWP is also lost in the form of 
carbon dioxide, but the HWP represented by durable wood products will slowly release 
its stored organic carbon over a longer period of time. The fourth stage is the disposal 
stage of HWP, when the discarded HWP enters the landfill and the carbon sequestration 
will be permanently maintained.

of carbon sequestration in forest products derived from deforestation and carbon se-
questration generated by the young forests. We have developed a forest management 
decision model based on an eco-environmental conservation perspective which con-
tains the social value of forests while ensuring that forests and forest products sequester 
as much carbon as possible. 
First, as forest managers, we decide to transform the forest by means of controlling 
the rate of cutting trees. In model 1, we construct a model for calculating the carbon 
sequestration. The amount of carbon sequestered in a defined forest is determined by 
the living trees and the forest products made from the harvested trees.  
Then, we design a three-dimension evaluation system of forest value – ESE Model. 
We classify forest values into the following three dimensions: ecological values, social 
values and economic values, and six subsets in detail. We quantify the qualitative indi-
cators first and then process the dataset. Using K-means Algorithm, we obtain the 
weight of every indicator. After assigning scores to each of them, we get GE matrix for 
the ESE Model. 
Finally, we introduce Beijing as a real case to derive suitable forest management 
scenarios with the help of Mod

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
"Trees are unguilty. You destroy them. You are guilty!" Some argue that we should not cut 
down trees at all to mitigate climate change, but in fact, proper logging is necessary and beneficial. 
Through establishing models, we demonstrate that forest management plans including harvesting 
can balance the carbon sequestration (CS) and the realization of other values.  
First, we establish a Carbon Sequestration Model to obtain the amount of CS including 
forest and forest products. In the calculation, we use the Conversion Factor Method (CFM) of 
forest stock volume, comprehensively considering trees, understory plants and wood soil. And we 
use a logical growth model to express the CS capacity and tree age to obtain a more real value. By 
adding the CS of forests and forest products, we can obtain the total amount of CS in year . 
Then, we establish a Forest Management Model for Carbon Sequestration combining the 
idea of Dynamic Objective Programming. We divide the forest into regions, using 
, 
 
and 
 to store information about cut or not, tree age, and death or not respectively. These 
variables affect each other. Combined with them and the CS model, we can obtain the amount of 
CS in statistical time, which is our objective function. Then, we get the optimal management plan 
by searching the optimal solution to the function. 
To comprehensively consider other forest values, we establish a Forest Management Model 
for Society. And we create a three-level evaluation indicator system, including four second-level 
indicators (carbon sequestration, biodiversity, cultural and recreational value) and 10 third-level 
indicators. We determine the weight of each third-level indicator by Entropy Weight Method. 
Considering different characteristics and geographical location of each forest, we use the Analytic 
Hierarchy Process to get the value score by weighting the secondary indicators to make the score 
closer to the real situation. Meanwhile, we use GE Matrix to evaluate the forest management plan 
based on the cost of realizing the value, and get transition points of different plans. By optimizing 
the distance between the plan and the optimal point in GE matrix, we obtain the optimal forest 
management plan for society, which may vary for different forest managers. 
Next, we apply our models to the Greater Khingan Mountains. And we obtain that the total 
CS of forest and its products after 100 years is 4.264 billion tons, among which the CS of forest is 
2.724 billion tons and that of its products is 1.540 billion tons. Then we establish a Nonlinear 
Programming Model and use Genetic Algorithm to get the best forest management plan: the 
ratio of the four regions realizing the value is 58.95%, 11.20%, 11.41% and 18.37%, respectively. 
Allowing logging 10 years longer than current practices, we modify the management plan to 
provide forest managers and all those who use forests with strategies to meet their needs. 
In the end, we write a newspaper

【Introduction】
----------------------------------------
1.1 Background 
Global warming is bringing alarming consequences around the world, including more extreme 
events, the rise of sea levels and the increased threat of extinction of plant and animal species. In 
order to slow climate change and protect human environment, it is not enough to reduce carbon 
emissions. We should also consider how to increase the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered from 
the atmosphere, known as carbon sequestration.[1] 
As the main body of terrestrial ecosystems, forests store more than 45% of all terrestrial 
organic carbon, and their annual absorption of 𝐶𝑂2 through photosynthesis accounts for 2/3 of all 
terrestrial ecosystems. Forests play a very important role in the global carbon cycle. Through 
logging, fixed carbon in forests can be transferred to wood forest products, which can store carbon 
in the whole life cycle of forest products. The disturbance of human activities to the global carbon 
cycle in the 20th century is an unprecedented phenomenon in history. Understanding the global 
carbon cycle and its impact on human activities is important for developing viable climate change 
mitigation strategies. 
 
1.2 Problem Restatement  
In order to develop guidelines for forest managers around the world to try to figure out how 
to use and manage their forests, our group undertook the following work: 
⚫ Design a carbon sequestration model to determine the amount of 𝐶𝑂2 that a forest and its forest 
products can sequester over time, and determine which forest management plans are most 
effective. 
⚫ Develop a decision model to determine a forest management plan. Consider the following 
questions: what are the conditions that would prevent a forest from being cut down; whether 
there are transition points between management plans applicable to all forests; how to use the 
characteristics of a particular forest and its location to determine transition points between 
management plans. 
⚫ Apply the model to a variety of forests. Determine how much 𝐶𝑂2 a forest and its products 
will absorb over a period of 100 years. Discuss what forest management plans should be 
adopted for the forest and strategies to achieve them, supposing the best management plan 
includes a time between harvests that is 10 years longer than current practices in the forest. 
⚫ Write a non-technical newspaper article explaining the forest management plan.

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
Firstly, we divide objects that can sequester carbon into two categories: living forests and 
forest products. In the calculation of living forests, we established a Tree Biomass Logistic 
Growth Model for the number biomass to obtain a biomass-time function, and combined with 
the scale of the real forest, rasterized the forest. We used the basic dichotomy model to cal-
culate the vegetation coverage，and linear programming model to calculate the Carbon Dioxide 
Containment (𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝒕𝒕) that can be sequestered by forests and their products over a while. The 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 is shown in Equation (12). 
Secondly, we established a decision model in the forest management plan, selecting eco-
logical benefits and economic benefits as decision variables, and the forest ecosystem service 
function evaluation system as the objective function, and introduce the priority factor 𝑝𝑝 as a 
constraint through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴), and get inspiration from the Gini 
coefficient, it is concluded that the Comprehensive Optimization Index (𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪) interval value is 
between −5.77 ~ 94.26, the forest system with 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 value closer to the right end point is op-
timal at the comprehensive level, and the characteristics of specific forests and their locations 
are combined with the priority sequence model. We propose a forest management plan optimi-
zation algorithm based on a specific forest set. 
Then, we established an economic benefit decision model, combined two expressions to 
determine the Intensity Of Intermedia Cutting (𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰), and divided the intensity of intermedia 
cutting into grades. The optimal harvesting cycle will improve the exist low benefit

【Introduction】
----------------------------------------
1.1 Problem Background 
IPCC noted that in the next 100 years, the average global surface temperature will in-
crease by about 0.74 degrees. Carbon emissions caused by fuel burning played an important 
role in the greenhouse effect. The traditional management of forests was carried out by com-
munity succession and restoration measures. 
Instead of them, we think forest ecosystem management should be based on the structural 
adjustment of the system and the establishment of an adaptive mechanism to maintain the forest 
ecosystem function and ensure its sustainable development.  
Technology and method of forest ecosystem management are not only an urgent practical 
topic in contemporary forestry production, but also an important theoretical and practical prob-
lem. Carbon sequestration is born with the urgent need of reducing carbon emission. This 
method considers both the carbon dioxide absorption of trees live and dead trees. Nowadays, 
the forest has potential benefits in more fields than what we thought. Comprehensive evalua-
tions are required in relating issues. 
1.2 Our Work 
First, we need to determine the amount of carbon sequestered that can be absorbed in the 
process of development and set up a carbon sequestration model. Secondly, how to balance the 
benefits brought by ecologic and economic is a problem that cannot be ignored, then set a 
decision-making model for forest management plans, and finding balance point. 
Afterwards, the established model will be applied to the case, if after the calculation, the 
management plan now is quite different from the current one. We have to theoretically prove 
the rationality of the improved policy proposed by the model. Lastly, it is important to develop 
newspaper articles and publish them in the local community so that both the public can be 
aware of current program changes and support our program.

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
Due to the huge role of forests in alleviating the greenhouse eﬀect, people are very concerned about 
the carbon sequestration of forests. However, in addition to carbon sequestration, forests also have 
many values that deserve attention and utilization.
In this paper, in order to comprehensively evaluate all aspects of forest value and formulate a rea-
sonable plan to promote forest development, we established an Eﬃciency-Estimation-Evaluation-
Management Model (E3 −M Model) . E3 −M Model is a decision model composed of three
sub models and forest management plans. Both The ﬁrst E model and The second E model are
used to analyze the carbon sequestration of forests, while The third E model is used to evaluate the
comprehensive value of forests and analyze the eﬃcacy of various management plans.
E3: Evaluation Model is a model that can evaluate the comprehensive value of forests, including
ﬁve indicators. We use The ﬁrst E and The second E to calculate the total carbon sequestration
and calculate the weight of each indicator by combining AHP and EWM. Finally, we will quantify
the comprehensive value of the forest in the form of a score. Then we will predict the future score
of the forest according to the BP neural network, and determine the best forest management plan
based on the change of the score.
Management plans: : Making the best forest management plan for the forest is our ultimate
goal. Our management plan can be divided into two parts: forest transition plan and commodity
system transformation plan. The adjustment of cutting cycle is the core content of the management
plan and we have discussed and analyzed it in detail in this article. Our model is applied to four
kinds of forests. Then we choose Bach Ma National Park in Vietnam as the speciﬁc research object.
The research conclusions are as follows:
• The total carbon sequestration of the forest in 100 years is 1.68 × 107 t.
• Increasing the cutting cycle can enhance the sustainability of forest development.
• Increasing the cutting cycle doesnt necessarily lead to the transition stage and transition point.

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
Current forest management plans prioritize economical proﬁtability with little con-
sideration of the forest’s ecological e↵ects. Thus, the managers fail to delibrately utilize
their precious and natural resource of forests as the source of carbon sequestration, the
process of decreasing the stocks of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere mechanically or
by the biosphere. Undoubtedly, this has led to severe climatic changes and environmental
unsustainability.
Incorporating social, economical, and ecological sectors, the model we present serves
as a novel approach to balance various factors involved in forestry. It re-optimizes the
pre-existing forest management plans and enhances eﬃciency, from a global perspective.
A sophisticated but limited model in real-life is The Faustmann Model[1]. It calcu-
lates the present value of the income stream for forest rotation and infers the optimal time
to cut the forest but is completely based on the economical portion of our world.
We designed the Comprehensive Index of Forest (CIF) to measure the synthetical
value of a forest, consisting of three indices: CSI, EI and BDI. The CSI takes the total
carbon dioxide sequestrated by a forest and its products into account; the EI values the
economical worth provided by the products; and the BDI is an important indicator of the
inﬂuence on biodiversity by the harvest. And we use AHP to determine the weights for
developed and developing countries. Moreover, considering the topology, we designed
AVF to measure the comprehensive quality of the forest more accurately.
Next we selected two forests from developed and developing countries as our case
studies for the model:
Quaking aspen forests: (representative for developed sector)
• Developed countries concentrate more on achieving social and ecological goals,
so the CSI weights more than the others and the tendency to cut down trees is low.
• Surprisingly, we found out that it is actually better to not harvest any trees.
Amazon rainforest: (representative for developing sector)
• Developing countries rely more on the economical e↵ects that the forest may
bring about, and hence has a much higher chance to cut down the trees.
• Being di↵erent from its developed counterpart, developing countries must
consider harvesting in the management plan to optimize CIF.
We also commented about the strengths and weaknesses of our models, and pointed
out the aspects for further improvement. And the sensitivity analysis is conducted at the
end. We focused on the analysis of the estimation of the average lifespan of products.
Finally, we wrote a newspaper article persuading some communities that well-prepared
harvesting may actually elevate the overall beneﬁts socially, economically and ecologi-
cally, rather than destroying the environment.

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
“Gabon is one of the world’s leading producers of wood. It enforces selective logging:
not more than one tree every hectare.” This occurs in Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s 2009 ﬁlm Home.
In reality, indiscriminate logging can increase soil erosion, reduce biodiversity, etc. But cutting
down trees and making them into woody forest products can be economically beneﬁcial and can
absorb carbon dioxide. Therefore, it is necessary to make a reasonable forest management plan
to plan the number of trees to be cut and planted to achieve a stable and balanced forest.
First, we propose a Forest-Harvested Wood Products (HWP) Carbon Sequestration
(FHWP) model and measure the amount of carbon sequestered by forests and HWP. First, the
forest is divided into trees, understory plants, and woodlands, and their carbon conversion co-
efﬁcients are calculated, and the forest carbon stock is solved by combining the forest area and
carbon density. Second, the carbon sequestration of HWP was divided into two parts, including
the carbon stock contained in wood and the amount of carbon entering the HWP pool in year
i. The HWP is divided into four types, such as round wood, charcoal, and wood panel, and the
carbon conversion factors of the four products are considered to predict the stock entering the
HWP in year i. Then, we add up the carbon sequestration of both to construct the FHWP model.
Finally, the model is applied to Russia and solved using an improved bat algorithm to derive the
carbon sequestration in Russian forests, e.g., 1.39×1013t of carbon sequestration in Russian
forests in 2020.
Second, we construct Carbon Sequestration-Economic Value-Ecological Protection (CEE)
model to make forest management optimal in three dimensions: carbon sequestration (CS), eco-
nomic value (EV), and environmental protection (EP). First, 12 indicators in the three dimensions
of CS, EV, and EP are selected, and the indicators are calculated using the current market price
and forest land revenue, and the data are normalized. Secondly, the entropy weight method is
applied to calculate the weight of each indicator. |C| indicates the overall level achieved by this
forest management plan under the three dimensions, and then CEE model is constructed. Finally,
the model is applied to China considering the 5-year transition period of the plan. Under the con-
dition of no deforestation, the transformation at 0.162% planting rate can reach the overall level
of 2020 in 2025, corresponding to a carbon sequestration of 3.0411×1011t.
Third, the model was applied to Sudanese forests to derive the best forest management plan
after 10 years of transition. First, Sudan’s forests from 2011-2020 was evaluated using CEE
model. Second, based on FHWP model, the current amount of carbon sequestered by forests and
their derivatives is calculated, and the amount of carbon sequestered after 100 years is predicted,
starting from 2020. Next, we optimized the management plan based on the best management
guideline-makin

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
As the lung of the earth, forest is the most powerful carbon sequestration player in 
nature. An appropriate forest management is conducive to the realization of sequestra-
tion potential. Therefore, we established the Tree-Products-Environment Carbon Se-
questration (TPE) Model to calculate how much carbon the forests can save over a fixed 
time, and proposed a set of forest management to maximize fixation efficiency. Then 
considered ecological, economic, tourism and entertainment factors comprehensively, 
established the Forest Management Evaluation (MFE) Model to score every manage-
ment, finally pick the best one. 
Firstly, net primary productivity (NPP) was used to measure the carbon sequestra-
tion level of forest, then the NPP calculation model evaluated by GLO-PEM help us to 
calculate the carbon synthesized by photosynthesis. Our TPE model points out that part 
of the carbon is stored in the living tree to activate the carbon cycle, another is fixed in 
forest products and decomposed over time, others is released into the atmosphere or 
environment because of the natural death of trees. On this basis, we advance a “Rota-
tion Regeneration” forest management, which prioritizes cutting the older trees, at the 
same time, set a harvest cycle and cutting ratio, planting new seedlings while cutting 
older trees. Then is applied to ChangBai forest, find that when the rotation period is 10 
years and the cutting ratio is 20 %, which can be the most effective plan, the carbon 
sequestration in 100 years is as high as 3.57 × 1010 𝑔. 
Secondly, considering the applicability to society, in addition to the ecological 
value of carbon sequestration, in terms of economic and tourism worth, we propound 
another two indicators of tourism experience and management cost. And give a scoring 
system by the MFE model based on AHP. Further, we put forward a management strat-
egy that balances the three indicators above. Based on the data of ChangBai forest, we 
get a best strategy when the rotation cycle is 15 years and the cutting proportion is 40 %, 
then take a sensitivity analysis. Applying the MFE model in different forests, we found 
that with the change of main tree species, the influence of three indicators on manage-
ment strategies will also change, by the way, the optimal strategy transit to the direction 
of forest value maximization. For example, from Muchuan forest with ornamental for-
est mainly to tropical dry deciduous forest with economic forest in Jhumpa, India, the 
best management will transit from long rotation cycle and low cutting proportion to a 
short one and high one. 
Finally, we contributed a magazine article to ICM about the necessity of harvesting 
trees for forest management.

1.1  Problem Background 
In recent years, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has in-
creased, resulting in global warming [1]. Carbon dioxide is the main influencing factor. 
At present, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 
280 𝑚𝐿· 𝑚−3 before the industrial revolution to 370 𝑚𝐿⋅𝑚−3 in 2001, and is in-
creasing at the rate of 1~1.5 𝑚𝐿⋅𝑚−3 per year [2]. It is necessary to take correspond-
ing measures to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  
Carbon sequestration is a process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. Forest carbon sequestration means that forest plants absorb carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere and fix it in vegetation or soil, thereby reducing its concentration in 
the atmosphere. The annual carbon exchange between forest light cooperation and res-
piration and atmosphere is as high as 90% of the annual carbon exchange of terrestrial 
ecosystem [3], which plays an important role in regulating global climate and maintain-
ing global carbon balance. 
Forests not only store carbon dioxide in living plants, but also exist in their forest 
products. Over time, the carbon sequestration capacity of trees and the longevity of 
forest products will change. In the long run, appropriate management strategies need to 
be conducive to maximizing carbon sequestration. However, most forests in the world 
have not been effectively managed, and carbon sequestration reaches the maximum [4]. 
It is of great significance to develop a good forest management plan to effectively re-
duce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.   
At the same time, forest manager also requires attention to value factors other than 
carbon sequestration. Due to the different composition, interests and uses of forests, an 
optimal forest management plan should be suitable for social needs and has the greatest 
ecological, economic and cultural value. 
Taking into account the above situation, we have constructed two models based 
on the existing research model and data.  
A Tree-Products-Environment Carbon Sequestration (TPE) Model was con-
structed to estimate carbon sequestration in a forest area. Then carbon sequestration, 
forest product value, deforestation frequency as ecological, economic, cultural and en-
tertainment value indicators. We build a Forest Management Evaluation (FME) Model 
to give the best management plan for society. Finally, the actual data are used for veri-
fication. We use the two models to analyze the given strategies for the forest regions of 
Changbai Mountain in China and the tropical dry deciduous forest in Jhumpa, Haryana 
State in southern India.

Because according to the data, the natural carbon sequestration of forests and their products

【Summary】
----------------------------------------
Forests play an important role in both nature and human society. In the context of "car-
bon peaking and carbon neutral", how to balance the economic and ecological values of 
forests has become an academic focus. We used differential equations, multi-objective 
planning, evolutionary games and simulation to find scientific management strategies for 
forests in different climates and to guide practice and development. 
First, we constructed a forest carbon sequestration model. Based on the differential 
equation, we investigated the carbon sequestration level under different forest management 
strategies, taking into account the forest area, tree age, climate environment, wood use and 
depreciation, and found that moderate harvesting helps to increase the carbon sequestration 
of the whole system. In addition, we simulated the adjustment of the harvesting rate 
 to 
find the best forest management strategy for carbon sequestration and calculated that 
. 
Second, in order to balance the multiple values such as economic value and ecological 
value of the forest system, we constructed six value systems based on the TEV model. Based 
on this, we constructed a value system balance model using multivariate objectives pro-
gramming and solved the maximum total forest ecosystem value (TTF) with the help of 
simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Thus, the optimal benefit is achieved with balancing 
the interests of multiple parties, and the TTF is obtained from the experiment in northern 
China category: 27283~40924.5$/km2/year. 
Third, the development of scientific forest management strategies is necessary to 
achieve the balance and optimum of forest values. The inverse mapping function is con-
structed based on the value system balance model to analyze the optimal forest management 
strategy under the corresponding state. Forest management strategies for general and special 
conditions are developed based on 4 medium forest harvesting strategies simulated for each 
of the 4 major types of climatic environments. We used a subtropical forest in China as an 
example, and validated that the 100-year 𝐶𝑂2 uptake for a harvest rate of 41.5% ~ 55% 
for near-mature trees and 80% for mature trees is found to be 442.2 ~ 820.8𝑘𝑡. 
Finally, the

【Introduction】

1.1 Problem Background 
Climate change is one of the central issues in international public affairs. Reduction of 
greenhouse gases is important. Carbon sequestration is considered as an effective method to 
reduce emissions [1]. Carbon sequestration is the safe capture and storage of carbon in the air 
[2]. Forests are an effective way to sequester carbon [3]. Forests and forest products are affected 
by the climatic environment and human disturbances [4]. It has been argued that scientific 
harvest management can improve the carbon sequestration capacity of forest systems. However, 
forest managers often need to balance ecological, economic and social values when making 
decisions. 
1.2 Restatement of the Problem and Our works. 
Considering the information identified in the problem statement, we need to address the 
following questions and perform the following tasks 
⚫ Develop a carbon sequestration model to quantify the amount of carbon sequestration in 
forests and their products, and use this model to design the most effective carbon-seques-
tration forest management plans. 
⚫ Build a decision model to help forest managers choose the best forest management plan 
and balance multiple value objectives. The model needs to consider the coverage of forest 
management plans, discuss the conditions under which forests will not be cut down, tran-
sition points between forest management plans, and characteristics of forests in different 
locations in the world regarding transition points of management plans. 
⚫ Apply the model practically to all kinds of forests, identify and select the forest that should 
adopts a forest management plan that includes a harvesting plan. Project carbon sequestra-
tion 100 years from now, identify the best forest management plan and argue its rationale, 
and develop a transition strategy that takes into account the sensitivity of forest managers' 
needs. 
⚫ Write a non-technical essay explaining the need for deforestation and convincing local 
residents that our management plan is the best decision to develop the forest. 
1.3 Literature Review 
Forests play a crucial role in the carbon cycle [5,6]. According to the Kyoto Protocol and 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), carbon sequestra-
tion in forest ecosystems makes carbon management a promising solution to combat climate 
change [7,8]. The use of forest resources has entered the stage of multi-value sustainable use 
of managed forests [9,10]. Currently, maintaining and enhancing carbon sinks and carbon stor-
age (CSS) in forest ecosystems is becoming a fundamental goal of sustainable forest manage-
ment [10]. Adaptive silvicultural practices, such as reducing intensive harvesting, may be one 
of the strategies to increase the long-term CSS of ecosystem HWP [11,12]. It has been sug-
gested that the carbon sink capacity of planted forests can be maximized by extending crop 
rotation and taking appropriate measures [13].
