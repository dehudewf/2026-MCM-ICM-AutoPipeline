1.1 Problem Background 
Climate change has long been recognized by the international community as one 
of the major global environmental issues. Greenhouse gases produced by human activ-
ities, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), have seriously affected the 
chemical composition of the atmosphere. With their strong ability to absorb infrared 
radiation, they have caused the rise both in the average temperature of the earth's sur-
face and in sea level year by year, inducing incalculable damage to mankind. Therefore, 
using forests, especially forest products, to absorb and sequestrate atmospheric carbon 
dioxide is an effective and practical way to reduce greenhouse gases. In a forest eco-
system, the carbon cycle can be divided into four stages [1], as shown in the figure 
below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: The carbon cycle 
 
The first stage is the absorption of carbon dioxide by the forest through photosyn-
thesis. The second stage is tree cutting, where part of it becomes logs to be used for the 
production of HWP (harvested wood products) and the remainder will rot or burn to 
release the organic carbon in it. The third stage is the wood use stage, where the amount 
of carbon sequestered by logs in the production of HWP is also lost in the form of 
carbon dioxide, but the HWP represented by durable wood products will slowly release 
its stored organic carbon over a longer period of time. The fourth stage is the disposal 
stage of HWP, when the dis

【Summary/Abstract】
"Trees are unguilty. You destroy them. You are guilty!" Some argue that we should not cut 
down trees at all to mitigate climate change, but in fact, proper logging is necessary and beneficial. 
Through establishing models, we demonstrate that forest management plans including harvesting 
can balance the carbon sequestration (CS) and the realization of other values.  
First, we establish a Carbon Sequestration Model to obtain the amount of CS including 
forest and forest products. In the calculation, we use the Conversion Factor Method (CFM) of 
forest stock volume, comprehensively considering trees, understory plants and wood soil. And we 
use a logical growth model to express the CS capacity and tree age to obtain a more real value. By 
adding the CS of forests and forest products, we can obtain the total amount of CS in year . 
Then, we establish a Forest Management Model for Carbon Sequestration combining the 
idea of Dynamic Objective Programming. We divide the forest into regions, using 
, 
 
and 
 to store information about cut or not, tree age, and death or not respectively. These 
variables affect each other. Combined with them and the CS model, we can obtain the amount of 
CS in statistical time, which is our objective function. Then, we get the optimal management plan 
by searching the optimal solution to the function. 
To comprehensively consider other forest values, we establish a Forest Management Model 
for Society. And we create a three-level evaluation indicator system, including four second-level 
indicators (carbon sequestration, biodiversity, cultural and recreational value) and 10 third-level 
indicators. We determine the weight of each third-level indicator by Entropy Weight Method. 
Considering different characteristics and geographical location of each forest, we use the Analytic 
Hierarchy Process to get the value score by weighting the secondary indicators to make the score 
closer to the real situation. Meanwhile, we use GE Matrix to evaluate the forest management plan 
based on the cost of realizing the value, and get transition points of different plans. By optimizing 
the distance between the plan and the optimal point in GE matrix, we obtain the optimal forest 
management plan for society, which may vary for different forest managers. 
Next, we apply our models to the Greater Khingan Mountains. And we obtain that the total 
CS of forest and its products after 100 years is 4.264 billion tons, among which the CS of forest is

1.1 Background 
Global warming is bringing alarming consequences around the world, including more extreme 
events, the rise of sea levels and the increased threat of extinction of plant and animal species. In 
order to slow climate change and protect human environment, it is not enough to reduce carbon 
emissions. We should also consider how to increase the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered from 
the atmosphere, known as carbon sequestration.[1] 
As the main body of terrestrial ecosystems, forests store more than 45% of all terrestrial 
organic carbon, and their annual absorption of 𝐶𝑂

【Summary/Abstract】
Firstly, we divide objects that can sequester carbon into two categories: living forests and 
forest products. In the calculation of living forests, we established a Tree Biomass Logistic 
Growth Model for the number biomass to obtain a biomass-time function, and combined with 
the scale of the real forest, rasterized the forest. We used the basic dichotomy model to cal-
culate the vegetation coverage，and linear programming model to calculate the Carbon Dioxide 
Containment (𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝒕𝒕) that can be sequestered by forests and their products over a while. The 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 is shown in Equation (12). 
Secondly, we established a decision model in the forest management plan, selecting eco-
logical benefits and economic benefits as decision variables, and the forest ecosystem service 
function evaluation system as the objective function, and introduce the priority factor 𝑝𝑝 as a 
constraint through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴), and get inspiration from the Gini 
coefficient, it is concluded that the Comprehensive Optimization Index (𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪) interval value is 
between −5.77 ~ 94.26, the forest system with 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 value closer to the right end point is op-
timal at the comprehensive level, and the characteristics of specific forests and their locations 
are combined with the priority sequence model. We propose a forest management plan optimi-
zation algorithm based on a specific forest set. 
Then, we established an economic benefit decision model, combined two expressions to 
determine the Intensity Of Intermedia Cutting (𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰𝑰), and divided the intensity of intermedia 
cutting into grades. The optimal harvesting cycle will improve the exist low benefit problem in 
the single-phase model. Referring to the intergenerational equity principle in resource eco-
nomics, the model is optimized to an infinite-time model, which can achieve the purpose of 
maximizing forest land income and maintaining forest function at the same time. 
According to the value of 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶, we applied the model to Saihanba and Canadian Douglas 
fir forests respectively, and used the MATLAB fitting toolbox to apply the forest management 
plan. We calculated that the Douglas fir forest should take 13 years as the harvesting cycle 
and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼= 35%, which will absorb 70,780,800 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 in 100 years. Furthermore, with 
the help of the boundary Kuznets curve, we quantify the relationship between forest users 
satisfaction and forest area under the assumption of an extended harvesting perio

1.1 Problem Background 
IPCC noted that in the next 100 years, the average global surface temperature will in-
crease by about 0.74 degrees. Carbon emissions caused by fuel burning played an important 
role in the greenhouse effect. The traditional management of forests was carried out by com-
munity succession and restoration measures. 
Instead of them, we think forest ecosystem management should be based on the structural 
adjustment of the system and the establishment of an adaptive mechanism to maintain the forest 
ecosystem function and ensure its sustainable development.  
Technology and method of forest ecosystem management are not only an urgent practical 
topic in contemporary forestry production, but also an important theoretical and practical prob-
lem. Carbon sequestration is born with the urgent need of reducing carbon emission. This 
method considers both the carbon dioxide absorption of trees live and dead trees. Nowadays, 
the forest has potential benefits in more fields than what we thought. Comprehensive evalua-
tions are required in relating issues.

【Summary/Abstract】
Due to the huge role of forests in alleviating the greenhouse eﬀect, people are very concerned about 
the carbon sequestration of forests. However, in addition to carbon sequestration, forests also have 
many values that deserve attention and utilization.
In this paper, in order to comprehensively evaluate all aspects of forest value and formulate a rea-
sonable plan to promote forest development, we established an Eﬃciency-Estimation-Evaluation-
Management Model (E3 −M Model) . E3 −M Model is a decision model composed of three
sub models and forest management plans. Both The ﬁrst E model and The second E model are
used to analyze the carbon sequestration of forests, while The third E model is used to evaluate the
comprehensive value of forests and analyze the eﬃcacy of various management plans.
E3: Evaluation Model is a model that can evaluate the comprehensive value of forests, including
ﬁve indicators. We use The ﬁrst E and The second E to calculate the total carbon sequestration
and calculate the weight of each indicator by combining AHP and EWM. Finally, we will quantify
the comprehensive value of the forest in the form of a score. Then we will predict the future score
of the forest according to the BP neural network, and determine the best forest management plan
based on the change of the score.
Management plans: : Making the best forest management plan for the forest is our ultimate
goal. Our management plan can be divided into two parts: forest transition plan and commodity
system transformation plan. The adjustment of cutting cycle is the core content of the management
plan and we have discussed and analyzed it in detail in this article. Our model is applied to four
kinds of forests. Then we choose Bach Ma National Park in Vietnam as the speciﬁc research object.
The research conclusions are as follows:
• The total carbon sequestration of the forest in 100 years is 1.68 × 107 t.
• Increasing the cutting cycle can enhance the sustainability of forest development.
• Increasing the cutting cycle doesnt necessarily lead to the transition stage and transition point.
• The
