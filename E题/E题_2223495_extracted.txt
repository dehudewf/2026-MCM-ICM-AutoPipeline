 Letting "Carbon" Stay: Forest Management for Ecological-Economic 
Balance in the Perspective of Carbon Sequestration 
Summary 
Forests play an important role in both nature and human society. In the context of "car-
bon peaking and carbon neutral", how to balance the economic and ecological values of 
forests has become an academic focus. We used differential equations, multi-objective 
planning, evolutionary games and simulation to find scientific management strategies for 
forests in different climates and to guide practice and development. 
First, we constructed a forest carbon sequestration model. Based on the differential 
equation, we investigated the carbon sequestration level under different forest management 
strategies, taking into account the forest area, tree age, climate environment, wood use and 
depreciation, and found that moderate harvesting helps to increase the carbon sequestration 
of the whole system. In addition, we simulated the adjustment of the harvesting rate 
 to 
find the best forest management strategy for carbon sequestration and calculated that 
. 
Second, in order to balance the multiple values such as economic value and ecological 
value of the forest system, we constructed six value systems based on the TEV model. Based 
on this, we constructed a value system balance model using multivariate objectives pro-
gramming and solved the maximum total forest ecosystem value (TTF) with the help of 
simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Thus, the optimal benefit is achieved with balancing 
the interests of multiple parties, and the TTF is obtained from the experiment in northern 
China category: 27283~40924.5$/km2/year. 
Third, the development of scientific forest management strategies is necessary to 
achieve the balance and optimum of forest values. The inverse mapping function is con-
structed based on the value system balance model to analyze the optimal forest management 
strategy under the corresponding state. Forest management strategies for general and special 
conditions are developed based on 4 medium forest harvesting strategies simulated for each 
of the 4 major types of climatic environments. We used a subtropical forest in China as an 
example, and validated that the 100-year 𝐶𝑂2 uptake for a harvest rate of 41.5% ~ 55% 
for near-mature trees and 80% for mature trees is found to be 442.2 ~ 820.8𝑘𝑡. 
Finally, the problem of adaptation to the transition phase of the optimal forest manage-
ment strategy is addressed. This paper introduced game theory to complement the model 
and used an evolutionary game approach to explore the behavioral decisions of forest man-
agers. Moderate deforestation is found to be the optimal outcome that satisfies the demand 
sensitivity of all parties. The simulation approach is then used to enable the above strategy 
to be validated in a variety of forest environments. 
In conclusion, moderate harvesting of forests is the optimal solution to enhance their 
ecological and economic values. Extending the harvesting cycle will help the current recov-
ery of over-harvested forests. However, it should be noted that for polar regions we still need 
to prohibit logging in order to protect them well.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Problem Background 
Climate change is one of the central issues in international public affairs. Reduction of 
greenhouse gases is important. Carbon sequestration is considered as an effective method to 
reduce emissions [1]. Carbon sequestration is the safe capture and storage of carbon in the air 
[2]. Forests are an effective way to sequester carbon [3]. Forests and forest products are affected 
by the climatic environment and human disturbances [4]. It has been argued that scientific 
harvest management can improve the carbon sequestration capacity of forest systems. However, 
forest managers often need to balance ecological, economic and social values when making 
decisions. 
1.2 Restatement of the Problem and Our works. 
Considering the information identified in the problem statement, we need to address the 
following questions and perform the following tasks 
⚫ Develop a carbon sequestration model to quantify the amount of carbon sequestration in 
forests and their products, and use this model to design the most effective carbon-seques-
tration forest management plans. 
⚫ Build a decision model to help forest managers choose the best forest management plan 
and balance multiple value objectives. The model needs to consider the coverage of forest 
management plans, discuss the conditions under which forests will not be cut down, tran-
sition points between forest management plans, and characteristics of forests in different 
locations in the world regarding transition points of management plans. 
⚫ Apply the model practically to all kinds of forests, identify and select the forest that should 
adopts a forest management plan that includes a harvesting plan. Project carbon sequestra-
tion 100 years from now, identify the best forest management plan and argue its rationale, 
and develop a transition strategy that takes into account the sensitivity of forest managers' 
needs. 
⚫ Write a non-technical essay explaining the need for deforestation and convincing local 
residents that our management plan is the best decision to develop the forest. 
1.3 Literature Review 
Forests play a crucial role in the carbon cycle [5,6]. According to the Kyoto Protocol and 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), carbon sequestra-
tion in forest ecosystems makes carbon management a promising solution to combat climate 
change [7,8]. The use of forest resources has entered the stage of multi-value sustainable use 
of managed forests [9,10]. Currently, maintaining and enhancing carbon sinks and carbon stor-
age (CSS) in forest ecosystems is becoming a fundamental goal of sustainable forest manage-
ment [10]. Adaptive silvicultural practices, such as reducing intensive harvesting, may be one 
of the strategies to increase the long-term CSS of ecosystem HWP [11,12]. It has been sug-
gested that the carbon sink capacity of planted forests can be maximized by extending crop 
rotation and taking appropriate measures [13].

1.4 Our Work 
 
Figue 1: The structure and process of the full text modeling 
2 Assumptions & Reasonals 
⚫ There are no large emergencies in forest ecology. Large-scale emergencies are stochastic 
in nature and cannot be modeled. Therefore the effects of natural disasters, such as sudden 
mudslides, forest fires, pests and diseases, and volcanic eruptions, are not considered. 
⚫ The forest areas involved are all operable in terms of management. Some remote for-
ests that cannot be used by human activities are outside the scope of this model. This is 
because it is neither "economic" nor "environmentally friendly" to manage them. 
⚫ All wood produced by the forest is fully accessible to the market. According to Say's 
law, in a free market, the total demand of society is always equal to the total supply . Our 
model defaults to all timber being available for sale.

4 Whole Process Carbon Sequestration Model for Trees. 
In order to construct a full-cycle carbon sequestration model for forest trees, two system 
levels need to be considered: the forest carbon flow system and the wood product carbon flow 
system. For the forest system, we need to consider the age of trees, their carbon sequestration 
capacity, natural growth rate and natural mortality rate under different geographical and envi-
ronmental conditions. For the wood products carbon flow system, we need to consider the ef-
ficiency of wood utilization, the depreciation rate and the end-of-life time of the products. 
We developed a differential equation-based decision optimization model for the sustaina-
ble development of the forest, which takes into account the regeneration continuity and the 
optimal carbon dioxide sequestration in the forest, so as to achieve the highest level of carbon 
sequestration for both native ecological and economic products under the premise of "sustain-
able development" of the forest. In the process of analysis, we use the Volterra model and ex-
pand the original model by using the tree growth environment, the environmental and economic 
values of forest products and the cutting plan of the forest to balance the harvesting strategy 
with the restoration strategy and the selection of high-quality and low-quality products, and 
finally solve the differential equation to calculate the CO2 sequestration of the whole system 
under different cutting conditions.

of the two systems is calculated by referring to the standard unit area of forest land sequestra-
tion level, and the sum is the carbon sequestration level of the whole process of forest trees. 
4.1 Tree Age Stage Classification Model 
Different types of trees have different growth cycles and rotation periods, which are ana-
lyzed through the papers of the biological model of trees, while the species of trees are different 
and the geographical variability is significant. Therefore models need to be constructed to deal 
with this relationship. 
Generally, the growth stages of trees are divided into four stages: young stage, middle stage, 
near-mature stage, and mature stage. In order to make the model more universal and robust, we 
fuzzify the years of tree growth and construct the following tree age stage division model with 
one growth stage of the tree as the minimum time unit t. (It is known from consulting the data 
that each growth stage of most exploited forest trees is about 10-15 years and the whole life 
cycle is 40-60 years). 
 
Figue 3: Tree age stage classification  
For plantations, the over-ripe stage accounts for almost a small percentage due to the 
presence of management and can be ignored. For natural stands, the number of trees in the 
mature stage is limited by competition due to the presence of natural competition, and again 
the proportion is small and negligible. The model was constructed for four age stages, A, B, 
C, and D. 
(A)Juvenile stage(27.0%)
Trees in the young stage grow slowly
at the beginning and gradually increase
in speed later, during which they are
often
affected
by
competition
from
weeds, miscellaneous, shrubs, etc. It is
the most unstable period for tree growth.
(C)Near-Maturity Stage(24.3%)
At this time the trees grow vigorously, 
branches and leaves flourish, flowering 
and fruiting appear and increase year 
by year, the diameter growth accelerate-
s, but the tree height growth gradually 
slows down, roots and crowns expand 
rapidly in all directions.
(D)Mature age stage(23.1%)
Trees move from robust to mature
age. The growth gradually
slows
down, especially the tall growth is
not significant, and the magnitude of
the longitudinal and lateral growth
of its underground roots and above-
ground crown parts approaches or
reaches its maximum.
(B)Middle age stage(25.6%)
The proportion of dry wood
biomass increased rapidly while
the proportion of leaf biomass
decreased
relatively
in
the
biomass of the forest community.
(E)Over-aged stage(0.01%)
The tall growth and diameter growth of the trees
are extremely insignificant, the life activity is
gradually weakened, and the ability to adapt to the
environment is greatly reduced.

The trees in stages A and B are in the fast growth stage and the timber stock is small, so 
cutting will not bring more economic value, so it is assumed not to harvest trees in stages A 
and B here. For stage C trees, moderate harvesting can be done, and for stage D, more har-
vesting can be done. 
4.2 Forest Ecology Model 
4.2.1 Climate Impact on Forests 
The growth rate and natural mortality of trees are related to the climate and environment 
in which they live. Drawing on the regularization of the world's major forest area categories in 
the literature study published by Derrahmane Ameray et al. in 2021, we visualized the forest 
area characteristics, climatic characteristics of the three major categories and derived the 
growth coefficient λ and natural mortality rate 𝜌 differently in different forest area types 
through a comprehensive assessment, as shown in the following Table. 
 
Figue 4: Basic information of the three major forest species 
4.2.2 General Forest Properties 
In order to make the model usable and robust even in the absence of data, the attributes of 
the forest in general state are measured. The percentage of each tree age stage in the natural 
forest. Checking the relevant data, we know that the retention rate of saplings growing to ma-
turity in the forest is 85%. The natural mortality rate at each stage can be set as 𝜌 and can be 
set to 
. It can be obtained that 𝜌 is approximately equal to 5%. Set up the

The percentage of trees in their natural state at each age stage can be calculated from Equa-
tion (1). For each tree age, the carbon sequestration level was set. The carbon sequestration 
level of larch plantation in northern China measured by Jia Yanlong based on CO2FIX model 
was set as 25𝑘𝑡𝑜𝑛 𝑘𝑚2. Meanwhile, the carbon sequestration level of different tree ages was 
weighted according to the CO2FIX measurement method, and the summary results are as fol-
lows table.

Forest trees and wood products. Both of these parts have carbon sequestration. In order to 
study the flow of carbon in both parts, the following flow chart of the whole process of forest 
wood was drawn. The first part, forest carbon sequestration: the model is divided according to 
the age stage by rasterizing and classifying the area of trees in each age stage of the forest. The 
specific process is shown in Fig. The second part, wood carbon sequestration, wood is pro-
cessed, used and finally scrapped. 
4.4 Steady-state Equilibrium Model 
For the forest carbon sequestration system: set 𝑋𝑖 to be the area(km2) of trees in growth 
stage i and 𝛽𝑖 to be the ecological carbon sequestration per square kilometer of trees in age 
stage i. The constraints and parameters to be considered are as follows: 
a) Limitations on the quantity of each tree age.  
b) The maximum area stock 𝑁 of tree age stages cannot exceed the maximum value in 
the natural state and at the same time will not exceed the area of its previous tree age 
stages. Constraints were set for 𝑁3, 𝑁4 as follows:

 is the natural 
mortality rate. The values are taken according to the forest ecological model con-
structed above. 
d) Set the carbon sequestration coefficient 𝛽. For the wood carbon sequestration system, 
the following limitations were assumed: 
 
Wood conversion rate, from trees to wood is 90%: 
 
 
Depreciation rate of wood products, set the average depreciation of all types of 
wood products 20% when scrapped, then can be calculated for each tree age stage 
(about 10-15 years) wood products average depreciation of about 10%. 
 
(3) 
Using the modified Volterra model, we construct a set of differential equations for the 
amount of carbon sequestered by trees and wood products at stage C age and stage D age. The 
equations (4) are as follows:

The initial state of the area of each tree stage is set as the area distribution in  
the natural state, and the initial amount of carbon sequestered by wood products is 0.  
The equation is solved with the help of Scipy. Let the solution of the differential equation ob-
tained be 
. 
4.5 Total Carbon Sequestration Measurement Model 
Referring to the above setting, the following formula can be derived:  
 
(5) 
The model was experimented with a larch plantation ecosystem in northern China by tak-
ing a 100𝑘𝑚2 area stand in natural state, and the trees' carbon sequestration capacity beta 
referred to the settings in the tree age stage classification model. The total amount of carbon 
sequestered when the system reached stability was calculated in three ways, respectively. 
Experiment with the model. Taking the 100𝑘𝑚2 area of larch plantation ecosystem in 
northern China as an example, the tree carbon sequestration capacity 𝛽 refers to the setting in 
the tree age stage division model. The total amount of carbon sequestration when the system 
reaches stability is calculated in the following three ways： 
a) Moderate deforestation and exploitation of forests. When the forest is reasonably 
felled, take 𝜇𝑎=0.3, 𝜇𝑏 =1. The total carbon sequestration of the system S=1360.3 
kilotons of carbon dioxide. 
b) No deforestation of the forest. When there is no harvesting of any age stage of the 
forest, i.e., 𝜇𝑎 𝜇𝑏 0, the solution yields the amount of carbon sequestered by the 
system at stabilization S=1242.7 kt CO2. 
c) Excessive deforestation in general. 𝜇𝑎=0.6, 𝜇𝑏 =1, S=1123.6 kilotons of CO2.

Note: Simulations were performed with 100 𝑘𝑚2of forest in its natural state. t indicates 
the number of tree age stages experienced. 
The analysis of the figure shows that. First, at the beginning of the system, any degree of 
deforestation will lead to a small decrease in the amount of carbon sequestered by the system, 
and then the amount of carbon sequestered will be increased in a short period of time. Second, 
when the system reaches equilibrium: (a) moderate harvesting of forest land helps to increase 
the total carbon sequestration; (b) no harvesting of forest will not change the carbon sequestra-
tion of forest; (c) excessive harvesting of forest land will lead to a decrease in the total carbon 
sequestration. 
Based on the above analysis, the system was simulated separately for different 𝜇𝑎 to cal-
culate the carbon sequestration level under each C tree felling rate, and the final results are 
shown in Fig 6. 
 
Figue 6: Carbon sequestration levels of forest trees under different 
 values 
From the above figure, it can be seen that the optimal level of carbon sequestration is 
reached when the felling rate is about 37.48% for trees of category C age. 
5 Forest System Value Balance Model 
TEV model proposed by American economist and environmentalist A Freeman in 2022. 
We use the idea of TEV model to measure the multiple benefits of forest ecosystem through 
multi-objective planning (MOP), and use Python to simulate differential equations, SA optimi-
zation algorithm and game theory to solve the model, so as to get Pareto solution, which is the 
better strategy after measuring the interests of all parties. 
5.1 TEV: Multiple Value Systems Within and Outside the Forest System 
Total forest ecosystem values can be roughly divided into six categories: output values 
(EF), carbon tax transfer (MF), tourism values (LF), ecological values (GEP), biomass values 
(CF), and other values (OF). Among them, the ecological value has a more complete account-
ing system and values in the academic community, so we will not repeat them here.

Figue 7: The value composition system of TTF 
5.1.1 Output Value (EF) 
We confine the output value of forest trees to the market purchase and sale of forest prod-
ucts, and take up the previous section on the harvesting of forest resources to establish the 
following set of equations:  
 
(6) 
Consider the fluctuation of timber prices with time and market conditions. where 𝑃𝑡is the 
average of the market purchase and sale prices of timber in period 𝑡. Based on the actual situ-
ation in felling, we constrain the equation as follows: 
 
(7) 
5.1.2 Carbon Tax Transfer (MF) 
The World Bank gives value transfers to areas that maintain forest ecology to absorb car-
bon.. The following is how the carbon tax value is calculated:  
In the first step, the carbon dioxide uptake capacity of the forest system is analyzed. The 
carbon dioxide uptake per unit time t is given by the equation : 
 
(8) 
When the system enters steady state, there are limits: 
 
(9) 
The formula (8) can be simplified as: 
 
(10) 
In the second step, we economically compensate the forest land according to the objectives 
depicted in Copenhagen Accord. Due to the inconsistency of carbon trading and carbon tax 
policies in each country, we adopt a fuzzy treatment and estimate the amount of carbon seques-
tered on forest land in the previous paper based on the following equation： 
 
(11) 
 is the carbon sequestration on forest land in period 𝑡 of the first problem; 
 
is the price per tonne for carbon trading, the specific values are shown below (for some coun-
tries) By weighting the recent U.S. carbon price, 
=51.2$/ton (CO2), and checking the recent 
news in 2022, we know that the CO2 price in the U.S. carbon trading market is about 50$/ton, 
which means the calculation is verified.
