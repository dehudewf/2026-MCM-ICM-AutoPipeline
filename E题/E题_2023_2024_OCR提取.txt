Veils of Uncertainty: Weaving Risk into the Tapestry of Preservation
Under the Weather's Watch
Summary

As the tapestry of nature weaves its unpredictable patterns, humanity’s quest for stability
becomes ever more pressing. In the shadow of uncertainty, we find resilience, crafting shields
against the tempests of fate.

First, we establish a Risk Analysis model to comprehensively assess the Expected An-
nual Loss (EAL) from extreme weather in terms of population, building, and agriculture. The
assessment for each aspect is calculated from three perspectives: natural hazard exposure, His-
toric Loss Ratio, and the likelihood risk factor of natural hazard annualized frequency. Com-
munity Risk Factor (CRF) is calculated from social vulnerability and community resilience:
EAL and CRF are used to quantify the risk levels of various regions and rank them using the
K-means algorithm, resulting in a risk level map of the United States.

Second, we develop a Risk-incorporated Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to aid
insurance companies in underwriting decisions. This model combines market return rates, the
tisk-free rate, and bankruptcy theory with a 10% bankruptcy probability to set insurance rates.
It evaluates if the region's residents can afford these premiums, providing decision-making ad-
vice for insurance companies.

More specifically, we apply our Risk-incorporated Capital Asset Pricing Model in Los
Angeles and Gorontalo. In Los Angeles, insurance companies see high profits and low risks.
However, in Gorontalo, the required premium for $10,000 coverage is $342.745, beyond local
affordability. We recommend insurance securitization and partnerships with local govern-
ments to reduce premiums. Consequently, Gorontalo residents could pay just $137.25 annually,
with companies projecting $245 million in revenue.

Third, we establish a Building Preservation Model, selecting seven secondary indicators
such as the annual number of visitors and construction cost, and three primary indicators: cul-
tural values and community influence, economy, and history. These are weighted using the
Sperman-CRITIC algorithm and AHP method to calculate building value, combined with
risk levels to determine the preservation level of buildings. Based on the preservation level, the
community's investment and measures for building protection can be determined.

Then our models inform investment and protection strategies for Tokyo Tower, acknowl-
edging its value and the necessity of preservation in an earthquake zone. We communicate these
findings and propose protection measures to the Tokyo Tower community.

Finally, we analyze the sensitivity and robustness of our models, the models can change
the insurance rate sensitively according to the change of the market predicted return and the
slight error of the risk factor calculation will not affect the models’ result, which verifies the
sensitivity and robustness of our models. In addition we analyze the strengths and weaknesses
of the models.

Keywords: Risk Analysis, Risk-Capital Asset Pricing Model, Sperman-CRITIC, AHP,
Building Preservation Model.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change. As the eco-
nomic costs of disasters rise, how should the insurance industry respond to losses? Extreme
weather events cause untold human suffering but and ever-growing economic costs.

Catastrophic risks consequently cause a variety of problems for insurers. First, because
the losses arise from a small number of lumpy events, the insurer may not have sufficient re-
sources to cover the losses. Less dramatically, the firm may suffer losses well in excess of the
value of the premiums that it charged for the coverage. In the absence of adequate reinsurance,
the firm may go bankrupt or may choose to exit a state in which there is a substantial exposure
to such catastrophic risks. The unexpected catastrophes or blockbuster events maybe raise the
tate that firms charge for insurance. Thus, for any given number of policies written, the total
premiums will rise "!).

The impact of natural disasters is equivalent to a $520 billion loss in annual consumption,
and forces some 26 million people into poverty each year. Given the gradual increase in the
number of extreme-weather events in the world, how to realize the sustainability of property
insurance is a great challenge we need to address.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

Considering the background information and restricted conditions identified in the prob-
lem statement, we need to solve the following problems:
> Problem 1: The property insurance industry faces a crisis from increased extreme
weather events caused by climate change, leading to higher claims and premiums.
> Problem 2: Insurance companies must decide on underwriting policies in weather-af-
fected regions, balancing risk and long-term viability.
> Problem 3: Participants are tasked with creating a model to assist in underwriting deci-
sions and a preservation model for community leaders to protect significant buildings.
> Problem4: The models should be applied to specific areas and a historic landmark, with
recommendations for future insurance and preservation strategies.

1.3 Our Work

In order to clearly illustrate our work, we draw the flowchart Figure 1.

2 Assumptions and Justifications

Considering those practical problems always contain many complex factors, first of all,
we need to make reasonable assumptions to simplify the model, and each hypothesis is closely
followed by its corresponding explanation:

¢ Assumption: The data we use are accurate and valid.

¢ Justification: Our data is collected from the World Bank and some other official web

sites and research papers. it’s reasonable to assume the high quality of their data.

* Assumption: The regions under study will remain peaceful and stable, with no signifi-
cant events other than natural disasters occurring in the foreseeable future.

* Justification: A stable capital market environment provides a predictable framework
within which we can project our expected returns. It is important to note that this as-
sumption does not negate the potential impact of natural disasters.

¢ Assumption: The estimated figures for each region represent an average level of per-
formance or condition for that area.

¢ Justification: For the purposes of this study, treating each region as a cohesive entity
allows for a more streamlined analysis. This methodological approach simplifies the
complexity inherent in regional studies by focusing on aggregate data, thereby provid-
ing a generalized view of each area's performance or condition.

4.2.1 Expected Annual Loss (EAL)

The EAL value are in units of dollars, representing the community’s average economic
loss from natural hazards each year. EAL is calculated using a multiplicative equation that
considers the consequence risk factors of natural hazard exposure, HLR (Historic Loss Ratio),
and the likelihood risk factor of natural hazard annualized frequency. The EAL value for each
consequence type is calculated by multiplying the exposure value of an area by the estimated

annualized frequency and the HLR.

EAL = Exposure X Annualized Frequency X HLR (1)

In Face of Increasingly Severe Extreme Weather:
Sustainable Property Insurance under Risk

Summary

The first priority of survival is getting protection from the extreme weather. —Bear Grylls

More frequent and severe extreme weather events are causing greater damage to people’s prop-
erty, leading to a reevaluation of the sustainability of insurance companies. On one hand, maintaining
enough customers for long-term healthy operation is crucial; on the other hand, avoiding excessively
high compensation risks to remain profitable is essential. Therefore, we assessed the sustainability of
the insurance sector in areas that were frequently impacted by extreme weather events from two per-
spectives: insurance demand and total risk.

For Task 1, we developed a Property Insurance Posture Model for insurance companies. We
categorized extreme weather into 4 types and used an ARIMA model to forecast the future risk of
extreme weather for each region-disaster pair, and calculated the expected loss. Then, we used Lane’s
AFC model to calculate premiums. To measure demand with premiums, we introduced the insurance
demand curve. Finally, we established Demand-Risk Equilibrium Model for Insurance(DBMI) to
provide decisions on whether to underwrite insurance in specific regions.

Next, we applied the model above to Australia and Southeast Asia, where approximately 60 years of
data from 3000 records were available. Then we applied ARIMA model on selected area-event series,
with an eminent fit: R? consistently above 0.625, and IC all below 300. Consequently, we forecast
the risks for 2024-2027. This has resulted in the determination of premiums ranging from $119.2 to
$1295.6. The optimal solutions indicated that in Australia, QLD and WA should be underwritten; in
SE Asia, PHL and THA.

For Task 2, we introduced Innovative Risk Prediction Property Development Method(IRPPDM),
which integrated DBMI with real estate companies’ willingness index to construct a Willingness-Risk
coordinate system. We specifically targeted High Risk-High Willingness areas, providing 3 possible
tisk reassessment methods to help transfer them into Low Risk-High Willingness category.

For Task 3, we used Historic Landmark Preservation Model to help community leaders. We
estimated the significance of historic landmarks by AHP method considering 8 indicators in 4 dimen-
sions. Then we offered suggestions considering both the extent of significance and predicted risks.
According to our model, Temple of Literature in Hanoi, Vietnam had a score of 0.463, facing risks
of floods and cyclones. Considering its features, we offered 4 tailored suggestions.

In the end, we stated the strengths and weaknesses of models. Based on their performances in
application, Property Insurance Posture Model reasonably balanced demand and risk, and Historic
Landmark Preservation Model was comprehensive in measuring value.

1 Introduction

1.1. Problem Background

Over the past few years, more than 1,000 extreme weather events have resulted in more than $1 trillion in
global losses. Swiss Re predicted that losses from weather-related events in Australia, Canada, France,
Germany, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. could increase by 35-120 percent by 2040, due to the impact
of natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. [1]

Figure 1: Global Impact of Natural Disasters[2]

The frequent occurrence of extreme weather events presents a complex challenge for the property
insurance industry. These events can lead to substantial financial losses due to increased claims, testing
the industry’s resilience. Insurers must navigate the dual pressures of maintaining profitability and
offering affordable premiums.

Therefore, there’s a growing need for risk assessment models that accurately reflect the high level
risks associated with extreme weather events. This will help insurers to price policies more effectively
and encourage investment in protective measures for properties at risk.

1.2 Our Work

For insurance companies, we have developed a property insurance deployment model to assist them
in selecting the areas to underwrite against extreme weather events, ensuring the sustainability of their
operations. Specifically, we measured sustainability based on the company’s total demand and the total
risk they face: Demand reflected the consideration of profitability, while underwriting risk was related
to long-term healthy operation. After the model was established, we applied it to two different regions
to validate its feasibility.

For real estate developers, we extended the insurance model mentioned above to assist in the
decision-making process for property development, providing insights on where, how, and whether

to construct buildings. Specifically, using the weather risk predictions obtained from the insurance
model, we provided corresponding strategies that developers could implement to mitigate risks during
the construction of properties.

For community leaders without the shelter of extreme weather event insurance, we have developed
a historical landmark significance model that assesses the significance of historical landmarks based.
on four aspects: history, culture, economy, and community. Ultimately, this helps them determine the
extent of protection needed for their historical landmarks.

2 Assumptions and Notations

Assumption1: Insurance companies bear the risk independently

Justification: In reality, insurance companies often diversify risks through financial products, govern-
ment support, and other means. Since we focus on the design of insurance products, we assume that
insurance companies do not adopt risk diversification measures.

DRS: WWSEE ES POR IMQQHELOTT 734962, tit!


[PAGE 5]
Team # 2401102 Page 4 of 25

Assumption2: Insurance demand is negatively correlated with price, and insurance demand re-
flects the number of customers.

Justification: Insurance, as a normal good, experiences a decrease in demand as its price increases.
And insurance demand corresponds to the number of insurance policies, and it can be directly seen as
reflecting the number of customers.

Assumption3: Existing real estate development processes do not primarily consider extreme
weather risk predictions.

Justification: Extreme weather events have low frequencies and high randomness, making them dif-
ficult to predict. Additionally, we conducted keyword searches on Google Scholar, and there is little
discussion on incorporating extreme weather risk predictions into the primary indicators for real estate
development.

Assumption4: The data we use is true and reliable.

Justification: Our data sources include international statistical agencies, academic databases, and rep-
utable insurance companies. Therefore, we can confidently state that the data we use is accurate and
reliable for modeling purposes.

3.1 The Types of Extreme Weather Events

According to USDA Climate Hubs, extreme events are occurrences of unusually severe weather or
climate conditions that can cause devastating impacts on communities and agricultural and natural
ecosystems.

NASA provided a brief summary of global extreme weather events, including heat waves, wildfires,
droughts, tropical cyclones, heavy precipitation, floods, high-tide flooding, and marine heat waves.[3]

As illustrated in Figure BL we mainly discuss the impact of extreme weather events on property insur-
ance, so we only focuse on four main categories: droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, and wildfires.

Wildfires . 3 Floods

Tropical YQ » Droughts

cyclones

Others

Figure 3: Four types of extreme weather events studied

¢ Wildfires: Dry conditions increase the risk of wildfires. With global temperatures on the rise,
some regions may experience more frequent and intense wildfires, posing a threat to life and
property.

Floods: Floods present a substantial threat to properties as heightened atmospheric moisture can
result in more frequent and heavier rainfall, which can overwhelm both natural and man-made
water management systems. This is especially true in coastal areas due to the compounding effect
of rising sea levels.

Tropical Cyclones: Tropical cyclones, fueled by warmer ocean temperatures and more humid
air, are likely to cause more severe and long-lasting rainfall events. These natural phenomena
can severely impact properties, particularly through enhanced coastal flooding, driven by rising
sea levels that elevate storm surge impacts.

Droughts: The rising aridity in certain regions, exacerbated by global warming, has adverse
effects on properties. This not only depletes ground moisture but also perpetuates a cycle of
warming and moisture loss, leading to soil degradation, foundation issues, and an increased risk
of fire hazards.

Others: Other types can be listed as heat extremes, heavy precipitation, high-tide flooding, ma-
rine heat waves,etc.

3.2. Predicting Extreme Weather Events: Based on ARIMA

To accurately calculate the expected loss of insurance products, insurance companies must precisely
predict the probability of various extreme weather events. This step is significant for insurance pricing
and risk control.

Given the uncertainty, complexity, and randomness of extreme weather events, we propose the use
of time series analysis method to fit and predict the frequency of extreme weather events more accu-

Summary Sheet

Navigating the Climate Labyrinth: A Dual Approach to
Insurance Resilience and Landmark Defense
Summary

The growing number of extreme weather events poses significant challenges for in-
surance industry, communities and property developers in terms of their resilience and
sustainability, which includes an insurance protection gap to mend, residential siting de-
cisions to make and preservation strategies to take.

In order to better comprehend and tackle the problems brought by deteriorating cli-
mate conditions, we build two models: Model I: Climate Risk Assess Model for Insurance
Companies and Model I: Landmark Preservation Model for Community Leaders.

For Question one, we utilize Peaks Over Threshold (POT) method to fit the distribu-
tion of disaster intensity measured by losses brought by extreme weather events. We ap-
ply hypothesis testing to fit the distribution of disaster frequency, and the results suggest
that the it follows a Poisson distribution. We calculate the probability of ruin (POR) for
insurance companies and determine the optimal retention and investment strategy via
ruin theory. Finally, we categorize risk into four levels and apply our model to Mumbai
and Cairns. The conclusion indicates the prediction of risk level of Mumbai will transition
from level II to III with predicted POR varies from 3.71% to 12.22% while the risk level of
Cairns will shift from level I to II with predicted POR varies from 1.33% to 4.40%.

For Question two, we enhance our insurance model by incorporating a Socio-Economy-
Insurance-Cost (SEIC) evaluation metric to make residential siting decisions.This enhance-
ment involves the inclusion of two first-level indicators, which are further divided into
eight second-level indicators.The weight assigned to each indicator is determined through
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), then development potential index (DPI) is intro-
duced for real-estate decisions making. Finally, we apply our SEIC metric to Miami, New
Orleans and Houston. The prediction results indicate that the DPI ranking for the next
decade is as follows: Houston > New Orleans > Miami.

For Question three, we select three dimensions including historical, economic and
cultural-community significance to assess the value of landmarks (VOL). In assessing the
risk of landmarks (ROL), we consider five types of risks including being uninsured and
several climate risks. Employing the AHP-EWM algorithm, we ascertain the indicators’
weights. Upon deriving the VOL and the ROL we take VOL as horizontal values and VOL
as vertical values to construct a GE matrix with nine sectors (I to IX). These sectors are di-
vided into five levels from A to E, which help us determine the preservation strategies.
Finally, we apply our model to Faneuil Hall and propose several preservation strategies.

Finally, sensitivity analysis of Model I demonstrated that altering the compensation
ratio from 0 to 20 percent resulted in a marginal modification in the POR value, confined
toa narrow band of 2 percent. This suggests that our model is not sensitive to market con-
ditions. Furthermore, robust test of Model II indicates that our model is robust against
perturbations. Combined with Model I and Model II, a letter for Faneuil Hall with con-
crete strategies and explicit agenda is composed.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

Global extreme weather events have been on the rise, a trend expected to worsen, as
per meteorologists [1]. Instances of hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires are in-
creasing, leading to more severe impacts on lives, property, ecosystems, and economies.
“Climate change is a terrible problem, and it deserves to be a huge priority” said Bill
Gates, calling for global attention to climate issues.

Figure 1: Extreme Weather Events around the World in Recent Decades

Such changes in climate have not only impacted the environment but has also had
repercussions on the insurance industry. These effects can be observed in various aspects
such as changes in insurance premiums, underwriting policies, and the cost of property
insurance. As a result, insurance prices have risen, and the availability of property insur-
ance has decreased. This has led to a significant insurance protection gap, which currently
stands at 57% globally and continues to grow. Consequently, insurers are facing a prof-
itability crisis while property owners are struggling to afford insurance coverage.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

To evaluate the long-term viability of the property insurance sector and establish the
most effective operational approach for insurance companies, ICM (COMAP’s Insurance
of Catastrophes Modelers) necessitates our attention to the issue of property insurance
and real estate decision-making. Additionally, we are to identify at-risk historic land-
marks and offer preservation strategies to the community. To summarize, our specific
objectives are as follows:

1) Task 1 Develop a model for insurance companies to determine whether they should
underwrite policies or take the risk in areas experiencing an increasing number of ex-
treme weather events.


[PAGE 4]
Team # 2407414 Page 4 of 25

2) Task 2 Adapt the insurance model to assess where and how shall property developers
build on to enhance the resilience the properties as well as the facilitation for growing
communities and populations.

3) Task 3 Establish a preservation model for community leaders to identify and adapt
rational conservation strategies to the landmarks of great cultural, historical, economic,
or community significance that are at risk.

4) Task 4 Create a concise one-page letter to the community outlining the comprehensive
schedule, plan, and cost for preserving their landmark with results and conclusions
yielded from our models.

1.3 Literature Review

Experts in environmental science recommend using weather insurance, which com-
bines risks faced by numerous entities based on the law of large numbers, to assist house-
holds and businesses in addressing unpredictable and severe weather events [2].

Data from Munich Reinsurance highlights a significant gap in natural disaster insur-
ance coverage. Only 45% of losses in high-income countries and 7% in low-income coun-
tries were insured [3]. Mills and Evan propose innovative solutions for the insurance in-
dustry’s response to climate change from an enterprise risk management perspective [4].
Herweijer et al. explore climate change threats and opportunities for insurers, focusing
on sustainable adaptation [5].

In empirical analyses, Aglasan et al. use a linear fixed-effects model to study crop in-
surance losses due to extreme weather events in the mid-western United States [6]. Hillier
et al. examine the correlation between meteorological time series data and residential
insurance losses using the aggregate exceedance probability method [7]. These studies
provide crucial insights into managing risks associated with extreme weather events.

In summary, experts advocate weather insurance for mitigating severe weather im-
pacts, while empirical studies highlight disparities in natural disaster coverage and pro-
pose innovative strategies for insurers to address climate change risks.

14 Our Work

The problem requires us to make informed decisions regarding property insurance and
real estate. Additionally, we are to identify historic landmarks that are at risk and propose
preservation strategies to the community. Our work mainly includes the following:

1. For problem one: We first demonstrate the intensity and frequency of disasters via
distribution fitting. And then we model the surplus process of insurance companies
and calculate the probability of ruin (POR). Our model is applied to Mumbai and
Cairns, interpretations of the results and strategies of insurance companies are made.

2. For problem two: Our insurance model is incorporated with a Socio-Economy-
Insurance-Cost (SEIC) evaluation metric and the Development Potential Index (DPI)


[PAGE 5]
Team # 2407414 Page 5 of 25

is defined for real-estate decisions. Our incorporated model is applied to three dif-
ferent sites in the US.

3. For problem three: A landmark preservation model is established based via AHP-
EWM algorithm. We employ GE Matrix with the assessed value and risk to enhance
the formulation of preservation strategies for specific landmarks.

In order to intuitively reflect our work process, the flow chart is shown in Figure 2.

2 Assumptions and Justifications

¢ Assumption 1: The catastrophe insurance business is a independent process and is
not correlated with other types of insurance.

“Justification: The risks of meteorological disasters iare relatively independent of
the risks associated with financial products such as bonds and stocks, thus the the
corresponding insurance products are also relatively independent of each other.

¢ Assumption 2: The insurance company has the ability to transfer its risk through
reinsurance and generate returns by investing in financial assets.

Justification: The insurance company manages the funds associated with catas-

trophe insurance business independently and with flexibility, thereby balancing po-
tential payout pressures from catastrophe insurance business.


[PAGE 6]
Team # 2407414 Page 6 of 25

¢ Assumption 3: The insurance products sold have a certain deductible, which is
borne by the policyholder.

Justification: By setting deductibles, the insurance company encourages policy-
holders to exercise caution regarding risks, and simultaneously reduces the payout
pressure on the company for smaller losses.

4 Model Preparation

4.1 Selection of Research Areas

In question one, we are required to demonstrate our model using two areas on different
continents that experience extreme weather events. We had Cairns, a northeast Australian
city, and Mumbai, a city in the western peninsula of India, selected for following reasons:

1. Mumbai: Mumbai faces significant challenges in the monsoon season, with heavy
rainfall causing floods and storms damaging infrastructure and residential areas.
Additionally, the city encounters the ongoing threat of rising sea levels. This presents
an opportunity for insurance companies to offer coverage for these extreme events.

2. Cairns: The Cairns region frequently experiences tropical cyclones, floods, and for-
est fires. The weather patterns in Cairns have shown a rise in extreme weather
events, making it an ideal case study for investigating how insurance companies
assess and provide coverage in response to the escalating impact of climate change.

Summary Sheet

Insured Properties, Assisted Developers

and Protected Landmarks
Summary

The increasing number of extreme weather events has left property owners and insurers in
similar predicaments. Increased premiums and reduced underwriting by insurers have put the
sustainability of the insurance industry at risk. In order to address this issue, we build a Model
of Decision making for Insurance companies (MDI). Then, the model is adjusted and used as a
basis to develop a Model of Site Selection for property developers (MSS). Finally, in areas where
development or insurance is not recommended, we build a Value Assessment and Conservation
Models for historical and cultural buildings there.

Firstly, based on the Information Diffusion Theory, we establish a Risk Assessment
Index (RI). Then, applying economic principles and Cost-Benefit Analysis, we build a Model of
Decision making for Insurance companies (MDI). Considering the sustainability of insurance
companies, we generalize the model to a multi-period dynamic model. Then, we applied the
model to Sichuan, China and Slovakia. Based on the data of last 20 years, we forecast the possible
future risk of insurance companies in the two regions by Gray Forecasting Method. Finally, the
calculation shows that both the two locations should be underwritten.

Secondly, we introduce the factor of property developers, allow it to interact with
insurance companies to adjust the MDI. The adjusted model contains resilience of buildings and
sustainability costs. Then, we create a Model for Site Selection (MSS) for property developers.
By assessing the benefits, costs, and risk of a certain area, we use a combination of Analytic
Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS method to synthetically evaluate areas and select the
optimal to develop property.

Thirdly, in the areas where development or insurance is not recommended, we build a
Model for the Conservation of Buildings (MCB) for community leaders. Through the Fuzzy
Comprehensive Evaluation Method, 4 aspects are used to assess the value of historical and
cultural buildings. Then, four conservation patterns are given and the cost of each pattern is
calculated separately. We choose the Ancient Residences in HuiZhou, China as an example and
apply our model to estimate the value (about US$1.055 million). The optimal conservation
method is in-situ maintenance conservation. Based on the results, we wrote a suggestion letter
to the local community.

Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis and evaluation of our model. The result shows
that our model is stable and can provide an effective reference for practical problems.

1 Introduction
1.1 Problem background

On 9 January 2024, the Munich Re Group released its Natural Disaster Loss Record for 2023,
which shows that global losses from natural disasters in 2023 totaled around USD 250 billion
and resulted in more than 74,000 deaths, and that global insured losses amounted to around
USD 95 billion, which is close to the five-year average (USD 105 billion) and higher than the
average for the last ten years (USD 90 billion). Losses such as the Fort McMurray Hill Fire in
Canada in 2016, Hurricane Ian in the North Atlantic in 2022, Typhoon Dusuari in China in the
summer of 2023, and Hurricane Otis on the west coast of Mexico in October 2023 are expected
to be the most significant among the series of extreme-weather events that have posed a serious
threat to the safety of people and property. Of all the economic losses caused by extreme-
weather events, property losses are the most serious.

The best way to hedge against property losses is to insure the property with property
insurance based on an assessment of the probability of extreme-weather events occurring. For
property owners in areas prone to natural disasters, by purchasing insurance and paying a
certain amount of premiums each year, when a disaster occurs, they can receive compensation
from the insurance company for property losses, thus making up for the excess losses. For
insurance companies, by selling property insurance to a wide range of consumers, they can use
a portion of the premiums they collect to pay for the losses agreed upon in the insurance contract
in the event of a disaster, while also reaping a certain amount of profit.

In addition, property developers can decide where to locate new construction after
assessing the safety of the area, in order to avoid building in the core areas where extreme-
weather events are frequent and pose a threat to the safety of their customers. When it comes to
the preservation of historical and cultural buildings, an assessment of the probability of a
disaster in the area can also provide guidance for the preservation of community buildings.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

¢ Based on the measurement of the risk of extreme-weather events in each region, a
mathematical model is developed to analyze the external conditions for insurance
companies to determine coverage, as well as to set the criteria for insurance companies
to charge premiums. In addition, the influence of property owners on the insurer's
decision-making is determined and extrapolated. And two highly representative
regions from different continents are selected to evaluate the calculation results of the
model.

* Another mathematical model is developed to calculate the resilience of property in
different locations and regions based on natural disaster risk assessment, in order to
assist property developers in identifying sites for property construction and

development with a view to providing adequate housing services for growing
communities and populations.

¢ For some buildings with strong cultural, historical, economic or human values that are
denied coverage by insurance companies, a third mathematical model is developed to
assess the value of the buildings and provide developers and building managers with
recommendations for building preservation. This culminates in a letter of
recommendation to the community with plans, timelines, and cost proposals for the
future of their treasured landmark building.

4 Task 1: Will insurers choose to cover weather hazard risks?
4.1 Building a Mathematical Model for Insurance Companies’ Decision Making

Property insurance is a broad term for a series of policies that provide either property
protection coverage or liability coverage for property owners. Property insurance provides
financial reimbursement to the owner or renter of a structure and its contents in case there is
damage or theft—and to a person other than the owner or renter if that person is injured on the
property.

In this section, we develop a mathematical model of decision making for insurance
companies (hereafter referred to as MDI).

4.1.1 Establishing a regional meteorological disaster risk assessment model

We have collected data on the occurrence of extreme weather events globally in recent years
and obtained the following map of the distribution of direct economic losses caused by extreme
weather events globally in the last three decades.

Direct Economic Loses. USS" 000

Figure 2: Direct economic losses caused by extreme weather events globally

For the risk of an extreme weather event in a region, we used a meteorological disaster risk
assessment model based on information diffusion theory. There are various information
diffusion models, and we chose the normal diffusion model. The basic principle of applying
information diffusion theory to extreme weather event risk evaluation is to divide the range of
values of the evaluation indicators into multiple discrete points, then diffuse the observation
samples of the indicators to these discrete points, and apply the principle of probability theory
after normalization to obtain the probability of the risk of a certain extreme weather event
occurring in the region. Firstly, based on the disaster occurrence criterion, the range of the
disaster indicator is divided into multiple discrete points ui to get the disaster index thesis
U{uy, U2, Us, ..., Um}, and for a single-valued sample point x of the observation, it is diffused to
the points in the thesis according to the normal diffusion model. The formula is

Summary

As the frequency of extreme weather events increases globally, the threat to prop-
erty safety is growing, leading to higher insurance claim risks and consequently rapid
increases in insurance rates. This results in potential losses for insurance companies
and unaffordable insurance premiums for property owners. This paper develops an
insurance model to assess whether insurance companies should conduct business in
these areas. Additionally, a protection model is established to identify properties of
cultural and community significance and to provide recommendations for protective
measures.

For Task 1, we developed an underwriting decision model based on whether the
insurance company is profitable as the decision criterion. Using Monte Carlo simula-
tions, we generated 100 insurance scenarios to calculate the probability of profitability
for the insurance company, which informed the underwriting decisions. Demonstrat-
ing this model in Guangdong Province, China, and Florida, USA, the probability of
profitable underwriting in Guangdong is 63%, while it is 26% in Florida. Therefore, the
insurance company undertakes underwriting in Guangdong but not in Florida. Addi-
tionally, when the base rate is high, the insurance company opts for risk-taking. Prop-
erty owners can influence the insurance company’s decision by using a risk checklist
to reduce the probability of property damage.

For Task 2, we improved the underwriting decision model to quantify the level
of real estate protection in different locations within specific areas. Furthermore, we
quantified convenience based on the distance from the location to living service areas.
Then, we established a goal programming model that maximizes both the level of
protection and convenience, solving for the optimal construction site using particle
swarm optimization. We recommend not constructing in locations with a target value
lower than 0.5 and choosing high disaster-resistant building materials for locations
with lower levels of protection.

For Task 3, we proposed a protection value assessment model that considers cul-
tural, historical, economic, and community values. Using EWM-TOPSIS, we calcu-
lated protection value scores and divided them into four levels: no protection (0-0.1),
first-level protection (0.1-0.3), second-level protection (0.3-0.5), and third-level pro-
tection (0.5-1.0). The level into which a building falls determines whether it is pro-
tected, with specific protective measures proposed for each protection level. For Task
4, we selected the Forbidden City in Beijing as the case study. Using the underwriting
decision model and protection value assessment model, we found that the Forbidden
City has significant cultural, historical, economic, and community values with high
sustainable development value. Its protection value is 0.618, qualifying it as a third-
level protection building.

Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the underwriting decision model
and protection value assessment model. With the investment interest rate varying
between [0.002,0.007], the insurance company’s decisions remain unchanged. A 20%
variation in the protection value indicators results in a total value score change of no
more than 5%, demonstrating the reliability of the models proposed in this paper.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

As the global population and economy grow, the frequency of human activities is
also increasing. The result of this increased human activity is an increasing concen-
tration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and an intensification of the problem of
global warming. Petteri Taras, Secretary General of the World Meteorological Orga-
nization, said in an interview in 2021, "Humans are no strangers to extreme weather,
but climate change has undoubtedly increased the frequency and severity of extreme
weather."

Extreme weather events are also taking an increasing toll on people. According
to the World Meteorological Organization, economic losses from extreme weather in-
creased 7-fold from the 1970s to the 2010s. And that’s a huge blow to the insurance
industry because it means insurers also face higher claims. The Boston Consulting
Group predicts that climate change will increase insurance premiums by 30 to 60 per-
cent by 2040, which could reflect a worse profitability for insurers. So how insurers
should adjust in an environment where extreme events continue is a question worth

1.2 Restatement of the problem and our work

(1) Problem Restatement: Develop an insurance model to identify whether in-
surance companies are underwriting in places where extreme weather is increasing.
And apply the model to two regions on different continents that experience extreme
weather events.

Our work: We construct a model of the profitability of insurance companies, using
whether or not they are profitable as the basis for decisions about whether to under-
write a policy. The probability of payout for each policy is quantified, and 1000 times
Monte Carlo sampling is performed, which in turn yields the profitability of an insur-
ance company in terms of a region. Guangdong Province in China and Florida in the
USS. are chosen to demonstrate the model.


[PAGE 4]
Team # 2410889 Page 4 of 23

(2) Problem Restatement: In a given region, the insurance model evaluates where
to build real estate, how to build it, and whether to build it at all.

Our work: Considering the degree of protection and convenience of real estate,
the farther away from the place where extreme weather occurs the higher the degree
of protection will be, and the closer to the living service area the higher the degree
of convenience will be. Therefore, we combine the insurance model to build a goal
programming model to solve to get the optimal construction location.

(3) Problem Restatement: Develop a conservation model that identifies the build-
ings that should be protected and the corresponding conservation measures.

Our work: We consider the impact of 4 dimensions: Cultures, Histories, Eco-
nomics, and Communities. We also establish a conservation value assessment model
through the EWM-TOPSIS method. Finally, the score is divided into 4 intervals: no
protection, primary protection, secondary protection, and tertiary protection, and cor-
responding protection measures are taken according to the protection level.

(4) Problem Restatement: Select a landmark that has experienced an extreme weather
event and evaluate the value of the landmark using an insurance model and a protec-
tion model.

Our work: Select the Forbidden City located in Beijing, China to assess the value
of the landmark and use the insurance model to get the probability that the Forbidden
City can enjoy the insurance service, and use the conservation model to get the value
of the Forbidden City in terms of its history, economy, and so on.

Justification:There are a large number of insurance companies in the world, and
one insurance company can buy insurance from another.

4 Underwriting Decision Model

For the underwriting decision modeling, our premise is that insurance companies
are "economic beings’. That is, insurance companies are most concerned with profit,
and when the profit is positive, insurance companies are willing to underwrite policies
ina region. In order to calculate the profit, we first consider how to evaluate the risk
of a policy in a region, which is set as Ro in this model. Then we develop a premium
pricing strategy based on Ro. To obtain greater income as well as to reduce risk, we
consider that the insurance company will redistribute the total premium income (set as
RI in this model) into reserve funds, investment assets, and reinsurance funds. Thus


[PAGE 6]
Team # 2410889 Page 6 of 23

the insurance company’s true income over the policy term is RI’. Finally, the profit is
calculated by subtracting costs from the true income RI’.

4.1 Policy Risk Assessment

To assess the risk of an order, we consider the external risk R& and the internal risk
Ré of the order. External risk refers to the risk of damage to the property caused by
an extreme weather event; internal risk refers to the insured property’s risk profile,
e.g., if the insured property has a high level of resilience, then the risk of damage
occurring in the face of equivalent extreme weather is lower. We believe that it is more
comprehensive and reasonable to assess the risk of a policy through both internal and
external risks.

(1) Quantify external risk RG

Most extreme weather events cause economic damage to the area, and insurance
companies then pay out to their customers. A higher number of extreme weather
events in a region means that insurers are exposed to a higher risk of paying out.
We therefore use the frequency of extreme weather events in a region in a year as a
measure of external risk, which is

Pn x 365 ”
Where, ewn; means the number of times the ith type of extreme weather occurs ina
year, and n means the number of extreme weather types occurring in a region during
the insurance period.
(2) Quantify internal risk Fj,

We use the risk checklist checklist methodology in risk management to quantify

Summary Sheet

Recast Mystletainn to Fight the Artificial God of Light

Summary

Bright windows, blazing streetlights, pulsating neon...human beings are slowly be-
ing deprived of the dark night. Since the invention of artificial light, this artificial light
has gradually started to affect animals, plants and human health. It is sad that the tech-
nological light that should bring convenience has brought harm. To better measure and
intervene in the effects of light pollution, we study light pollution to better enjoy this light.

Several models are established: Model I: Pollution Quantification Model; Model II:
Risk Assessment Model; Model III: Intervention Strategy Model.

Prepare for establishing models, we analyzed the composition and main impact as-
pects of light pollution. By visualizing the results of a large number of data collected from
official databases, we initially focused on areas worth studying.

For Model I: According to some literature and the results of similar natural system
studies, we propose to use human factors, social factors and ecological factors, a total
of 13 indicators, combined with EWM-AHP algorithm.to obtain objective light pollution
quantification results Qpositive, Qnegative.e Then we,tandomly selected ten areas of light
intensity and our model calculation for comparison, the’ Pearson correlation coefficient is
0.8002, which verifies the validity of our model.

For Model II: We defined a light pollution’ risk indicator Q based on the ALARP cri-
terion and "Cost-Risk" analysisywhere the negative impact growth rate is assumed to be
normally distributed. Basedjon the diterature, we calculate the expectation of 6% and ap-
ply Q to the four regions ‘we selected to evaluate the risk of light pollution after one year
and analyze it to propose countermeasures. Theoretically, the model allows for medium-
and long-term prediction of light pollution risk.

For Model III: We modeled three different strategies - "energy", "environment", "hu-
man security" and related factors respectively, and finally obtained the feasibility of inter-
vention scenarios through coupling coordination analysis, And the final evaluation value
of the three aspects is calculated through the secondary indicators after the intervention.
We selected two sites, Rutland and Westminster with a coordination index of 5 and 3,
to study the impact of the three intervention strategies based on a coupled coordination
analysis. The results showed that the best intervention strategy in rural Rutland was the
"Human Friendly Strategy", which improved the Human Health Index score by 10%.
The best intervention strategy for Westminster was the Resource Friendly Strategy, which
improved the overall score from 50.0080 to 59.6481.

Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity analysis by adjusting the parameter r of the en-
vironmental part of the LPA model up or down by 5%, and the results showed that our
pollution quantification model was more resistant to interference. Afterwards, we cre-
ated a flyer to inform people in the Westminster area of the UK about the effects of light
pollution and the options and benefits of implementing a lighting curfew.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

"When I see photos of this, of the
Earth, I see environmental catastrophe.
These aren’t jewels, those are tumors."
said Kelsey Johnson in her TED speech
"The problem of light pollution — and 5
ridiculously easy ways to fix it". Light
is a fundamental component of the world
and one of the pillars of civilization. The
development of human civilization has
been accelerated by the invention of arti-
ficial light and its use. Figure 1: Night View of the Earth Showed in
Kelsey Johnson’s Speech

However, with the rapid growth of ar-
tificial light usage year by year, the poor
and excessive use of artificial light has also caused.serious consequences: astronomical
light pollution has caused the degradation of thesnightsky scene, and the exploration of
the depths of the universe is limited [1], ecological light pollution not only pollutes the air,
ocean currents, etc. but also makes the maturation of plants delayed or accelerated, the
migration patterns of wild animals change while including humans, obesity, insomnia,
physical and mental health damage,ete. The problems are rapidly increasing.

Artificial light is a double-edged sword, which brings blessings and opens Pandora’s
Box. One of the key issues.and turning points for the future advancement of human soci-
ety will be how to reduce the effects of light pollution through appropriate intervention.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

The management of light pollution problems is a complex issue that requires full con-
sideration of various factors. To measure and mitigate the effects of light pollution at
different locations, we need to complete the following questions:

¢ Create a broadly applicable indicator that will allow measurement of the risk levels
of light pollution at various locations.

e Apply the indicator to four distinct site types and offer a logical analysis of the find-
ings.

e Put out three potential intervention options to deal with light pollution, along with
a discussion of the precise steps required for each strategy and its potential effects.

e Apply the indicators to two locations, determine the best intervention plan for each
site, and go over how that intervention strategy affects the level of risk at that site.

¢ Make a flyer outlining the most effective intervention method for one of the indi-
cated sites.

1.3 Literature Review

We searched the literature with the keyword "light pollution" and found that the re-
search on this issue in recent years can be divided into three main parts: the composition
of light pollution, the determination of the data space of light pollution modeling, and
the way light pollution affects biological populations. The following will mainly discuss
the proposed models.

¢ First, as far as the composition of light pollution is concerned: light pollution is
commonly divided into white bright pollution, daytime pollution, and color pollution,
with the difference that in [2], Zhaoli Liu et al. considered light pollution throughout the
day, while the vast majority of authors only studied light pollution at night.

¢ Second, the light pollution modeling data space can be divided into two-dimensional
and three-dimensional. M. Liu et al. partly used two-dimensional data such as image data
and remote sensing data for modeling [3], while Zheng Wen et al. combined height and
other information for modeling three-dimensional data [4].

¢ Finally, the effects of light pollution on biological populations have both macroscopic
and microscopic dimensions. Xuefeng Tang et al. espa hes of light pollution
from different light sources on the microvasculature iz s [5], while more authors
have explored the effects of extensive light pollution habits and health of organisms
at the macroscopic level. aes

* The advantages and disadvantages ferent research methods for different con-

cerns of light pollution can be vigug|iZed as shown in Figure 2.

2 Assumptions a lanations

Considering those oh erical problems always contain many complex factors, first of
all, we need to make reasonable assumptions to simplify the model, and each hypothesis
is closely followed by its corresponding explanation:

v Assumption 1: The data we use are accurate and valid.

4 Explanations: The data in this article comes directly from the latest results of the
major online official databases and published literature.

v Assumption 2: Light pollution in the night mainly for light pollution, daytime light
pollution is almost negligible.

4 Explanations: Due to the long-term formation of biological habits and ecological
laws during the day, under the augmentation of natural light, the impact of light pollu-
tion during the day is minimal compared to the impact of light pollution at night.

v Assumption 3: The natural light pollution part of the light pollution we are dis-
cussing is represented by aurora pollution.

4 Explanations: Most of the natural light pollution only affects biology and society
during daytime, based on assumption 2, we think this part of natural light pollution can


[PAGE 6]
Team # 2301428 Page 6 of 25

be neglected, so the natural light pollution part only focuses on the aurora borealis pollu-
tion to simplify the model.

v Assumption 4: The composition of biological populations at the sites studied by our
model, such as the proportion of vertebrates and invertebrates to biological populations,
is relatively stable.

4 Explanations: The "biological population" is a large concept, and biodiversity makes
light pollution affect each organism differently, so we make this assumption to better focus
on the quantification and intervention of light pollution.

Additional assumptions are made to simplify analysis for individual sections. These
assumptions will be discussed at the appropriate locations.

4 Model Preparation

4.1 Light Pollution Composition and Impact

Light pollution is a large and complex concept, the consensus of most studies is that
the source of pollution is divided into natural light pollution and artificial light pollution,
according the composition of pollution is divided into white bright pollution, daytime
pollution, colored light pollution, according to the common form of pollution can be di-
vided into glare, spill light, and light trespass...

The composition of light pollution is very complex, but it is undeniable that no matter
what light pollution will cause a huge impact. Most studies classify the effects of light
pollution into 3 aspects: socio-economic, ecological, and physiological, the specific effects
are shown in Figure 4.

Summary Sheet

Turn out the Lights, Turn up the Stars
Summary

Light pollution is a type of environmental pollution caused by human activities, which has
negative impacts on wildlife, plants, and human health. With the continuous development of
urbanization and industrialization, the problem of light pollution is becoming increasingly se-
vere. Therefore, the evaluation and improvement of the risk level of light pollution 1s particu-
larly important.

Firstly, we collected data on ten indicators from 55 regions and divided these ten indicators
into three areas: Light, Society, and Nature. Then we combined the analytic hierarchy process,
entropy weight method, and coefficient of variation method to calculate the combined
weights of these indicators to construct the formula of light pollution index (LPI) and then build
the LSN evaluation model. Finally, we use fuzzy cluster analysis to classify all locations into
four categories, thus dividing the light pollution level into four classes.

Secondly, we choose New York City, Bellevue, Sedona and Yellowstone National Park as
a representative of each location type. Using the LSN evaluation model, their LPI were cal-
culated to be 35.55, 41.33, 76.94, 84.18. Thus, their light pollution levels were obtained as
Grade I, Grade II, Grade III, Grade IV respectively,

Thirdly, we proposed three intervention strategies and their specific actions, constructed
a PIA-NN model, and studied the potential effects of concrete actions on light pollution effects.
The three intervention strategies are* reduce artificial light intensity & strengthen publicity and
education & expand vegetation.area’ We quantitatively reflected the "potential impact" of the
three intervention strategiésonrthe light pollution effect by combining Spielman's correlation
coefficient and the BP neural network model.

Next, we selected two representative regions, Sedona and New York City, to explore the
effects of three intervention strategies on light pollution levels in the two regions using the
PIA-NN model and the LSN evaluation model. The results show that for both areas, reducing
the intensity of artificial light is the most effective intervention strategy to reduce the risk level
of light pollution.

Finally, we will choose New York City as the location for the campaign and design a
beautiful flyer around its corresponding most effective intervention strategy.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

Light pollution was first raised by astronomers in the 1950s.'"! With the acceleration of
urbanization and economic development, the demand for night lighting gradually increased. At
the same time, humans overuse or use artificial light sources unreasonably at night, which de-
stroys the natural darkness. According to data from the International Dark-Sky Association,
over 80% of the global population lives in areas affected by, Jight pollution,! and about 99%
of urban residents in Europe and the United States cannotobserve the Milky Way at night.'?! In
many large cities worldwide, the brightness at night can even reach the level of daytime.

The issue of light pollution is increasingly-affeeting people's daily lives, including work
and leisure activities. It not only disrupts the beautiful view of our night sky but also has neg-
ative impacts on human health, safety,,and the ecological environment. According to astronom-
ical studies, a clear sky free ofaght pollution can display around 7,000 stars, while only 20-60
stars are visible in large eitiés. Excessive artificial light at night can disturb the circadian rhythm
of living organisms, leading to poor sleep quality and higher rates of insomnia. Moreover, ex-
cessive light exposure to the human eye can damage the retina and iris, resulting in a sharp
decline in vision. High beam lights on well-lit city streets can also cause transient "visual loss"
to pedestrians or drivers on the opposite side of the street, contributing to a higher incidence of
traffic accidents. Additionally, light pollution can also alter the growth cycle of plants and affect
the migration patterns of wildlife.

Therefore, the issue of light pollution requires urgent attention and regulation globally

1.2 Our Work

First, we propose the Light-Society-Nature (LSN) Evaluation Model, which is used to
evaluate the light pollution risk level of a location. Specifically, the model considers many
indicators reflecting light pollution. Based on these indicators, we establish a secondary eval-
uation system. Considering that different methods have their limitations, the weights of the
indicators are determined by a combination of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Entropy
Weight Method (EWM), and Coefficient of Variation Method (CVM). We select 55 representa-
tive locations worldwide and calculate their light pollution index based on relevant data, and
the different levels of light pollution were determined by fuzzy clustering.


[PAGE 4]
Team # 2305598 Page 4 of 24

Second, we selected four different types of locations in the US and used the LSN evalua-
tion model to calculate the light pollution index for each location, and analyzed the reasona-
bleness of the results with the actual local conditions.

Then, in our previously constructed indicators, we have proposed three intervention strat-
egies while taking into account their feasibility. For each intervention strategy, specific actions
have been provided. We also build a PIA-NN model to analyze the potential impact of these
actions on light pollution effects. The results will be visualized and analyzed for rationality.

Thereafter, we select two locations from Task 2 as our study subjects and use the PIA-NN
model and the LSN evaluation model to analyze the impact of three intervention strategies on
their light pollution risk levels, and make corresponding analyses.

Finally, we will choose New York City as the location for the campaign and design a
beautiful flyer around its corresponding most effective intervention strategy.

2 Assumptions and Justifications

Assumption1: In this paper, LPI (Light Pollution Index) is defined as the score of the light
environment of a region. The higher the LPI value, the lower the level of light pollution in the
region.
Justification: The lower the level of light pollution in an area, the better the light envi-
ronment in that place. Depending on people's usage habits, it is common for better condi-
tions to correspond to higher scores.
Assumption2: In the correlation analysis, only factors with strong correlation are retained and
factors with small correlation are removed.


[PAGE 5]
Team # 2305598 Page 5 of 24

Justification: The factors affecting light pollution are complex. If factors of lesser rele-
vance are also taken into account, it will make the study results less significant and may
even produce misleading conclusions.

Assumption3: Assume the data collected from the internet is true and reliable.
Justification: In the process of studying light pollution, we select the most typical areas
in the world, so the extensiveness of the data is guaranteed; all data are obtained from the
official website, so the reliability of the data is guaranteed

4 Light-Society-Nature (LSN)Evaluation Model

In this section, we establish the Light-Society-Nature (LSN) Evaluation Model to measure
the light pollution risk level of a location in a region broadly. Firstly, after determining indica-
tors of every level, we established a comprehensive evaluation system.'*! And then the weight
of each indicator is determined by the combined weight method. Finally, we calculated the
Light-Pollution Index (LPI), so as to identify the light pollution risk level of a location.

Considering that the risk level of light pollution varies greatly in different locations within
a large range, we should choose as small a location as possible, such as a community or a
residential district, when discussing the risk level of light pollution, rather than choosing a large
area such as a country or a city. Therefore, we screened 55 representative sites around the world
and used relevant data of these 55 sites as the database of this paper. Based on this, we estab-
lished the Light-Society-Nature (LSN) Evaluation Model.

4.1 Establishment of evaluation system

After referring to a large number of previous studies and relevant papers, we summarized
three key factors reflecting the risk level of light pollution: light factor (L), social factor (S)
and natural factor (N), which were taken as the first-level indicators in the evaluation system.
After further thinking and induction, we concretized the indicators and selected 10 specific
indicators as the second-level indicators in the evaluation system.'! The specific evaluation
system is as follows, as shown in the Figure 2.

4.1.1 Light I

The light factor is the most important factor in determining the risk level of light pollution.
After a lot of literature review and rigorous analysis, we finally determined that the specific
light factor include the following four points:

L,. Artificial light intensity

Artificial light intensity refers to the brightness of light generated by human activities. In
light pollution research, artificial light intensity is an important indicator, which is used to
measure the intensity and influence of artificial light on the surrounding environment at night.
Artificial light intensity is usually measured using photometers or related measuring instru-
ments, and it is measured in units of candela/square meter (wcd/m7’ ), indicating the brightness
of the light source per unit area. The data of artificial light intensity can be obtained through
the official website of Light pollution map.

L,. Artificial light density
Artificial light density refers to the number of artificial lights in a certain location, usually

expressed by the number of lights per unit area, such as the number of street lamps per square
kilometer. High artificial light density means that there are more lights in an area. These lights

Protect the Night, Control the Light!

Summary

People generally are struck by the ‘beauty’ of city lights without realizing that these
are also images of pollution, like admiring the beauty of the rainbow colours that gaso-
line produces in water and not recognising that it is chemical pollution. In this paper,
we construct a broadly applicable Light Pollution Risk Assessment Model to assess the
risk level of a given location, and propose an Intervention Strategy Model to mitigate
the effects of light pollution in various locations.

For Task 1, we propose a Light Pollution Risk Assessment Model. The model
integrates risks from four dimensions: humans, wildlife, plants, and energy waste
caused by light pollution. Considering multiple related indicators, EWM-TOPSIS is
applied to solve the overall risk score, which is divided into four levels: fragile(0-1),
poor(1-2), ordinary(2-3), and good(3-4).

For Task 2, the Light Pollution Risk Assessment Model is applied to four typical
regions in Shenzhen, representing urban, suburban, rural,and protected areas. In the
data preparation phase, we use nighttime remote sensing and multi-spectral remote
sensing data to estimate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), night-
time radiance, and population density in the study areas. The protected area has a risk
score of 0.357992, while the rural community has:a risk score of 1.859474, the subur-
ban community has a risk score of 2.114942, and the urban community has a risk score
of 3.19662. These scores correspond to the fragile, poor, ordinary, and good levels,
respectively.

For Task 3, we develop ‘three intervention strategies including improving the light
source, lowering the lighting intensity and optimizing regional light layouts. Then
we list multiple specific actions for each strategy. Intervention Strategy Model based
on Differential Equation is established to quantify how three strategies impact the
risk level.

For Task 4, we select urban and suburban communities to verify the effectiveness
of the three intervention strategies. Over the next 50 years, the risk scores after the
implementation of the three strategies are reduced by approximately 2%, 6%, and 3%
respectively. It can be concluded that the second strategy, lowering the lighting in-
tensity that aims to reduce the total amount of light radiance is the most effective
intervention strategy for both urban and suburban areas.

Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the risk assessment model shows that the fluctua-
tion of a single evaluation indicator by -10% - 10% has a reasonable impact on the final
risk score shown in Figure 16. Therefore, the model is robust to changes in a single
indicator. Besides, the sensitivity analysis of the Strategy Model shown in Figure 17
means that our model is robust to the growth rate.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

Looking at the International Space Station’s images of the Earth at night, people
generally are struck by the ‘beauty’ of city lights, as if they were lights on a Christmas
tree, without realizing that these are also images of pollution. It is like admiring the
beauty of the rainbow colours that gasoline produces in water and not recognising that
it is chemical pollution.

The inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light, known as light pollution, can
have serious environmental consequences for humans, wildlife, and our climate. Com-
ponents of light pollution include:

e Light trespass: light falling where it is not intended or needed
¢ Over-illumination: lighting intensity higher than that which is appropriate
e Light cluster: bright, confusing and excessive grouping of light sources

The impacts of light pollution can be far-reaching and varied, affecting both natural
and human systems. There is a growing body of evidenee that links light pollution to
measurable negative impacts on human health, wildlife; and the environment. Some
examples of these negative impacts include:

e Harming human health and effecting*crime and safety
e Disrupting the ecosystem and wildlife

e Increasing energy consumption

e Affecting astronomical observations

It is important to undérstand these impacts and to take steps to mitigate them to
minimize the negative effects on our environment, health, and economy. There’s a lot
of room for improvement - if we light more carefully, we should be able to reduce
negative influences, whilst still lighting the ground.

There are several intervention strategies that can be employed to address light pol-
lution, such as using shielded, directional and energy-efficient lighting, enacting light-
ing ordinances and implementing lighting curfews etc.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

We were asked by COMAP’s Illumination Control Mission (ICM) to promote aware-
ness of the impacts of light pollution and develop intervention strategies to mitigate
negative impacts.

Task 1:

Task 2:

Task 3:

Task 4:

Address a broadly applicable metric to measure the light pollution risk level
of a location, incorporating both human and non-human concerns.

Apply our metric and interpret its results on four diverse types of locations in-
cluding a protected land location, a rural community, a suburban community,
and an urban community.

Outline three possible intervention strategies to address light pollution and
discuss specific actions that can be taken to implement each strategy. Consider
the potential impacts of these actions on the overall effects of light pollution.

Select two locations and apply the previously developed metric to determine
the most effective intervention strategy for each location in addressing light
pollution. Discuss how the chosen intervention strategy impacts the risk level
for the location.

2 Assumptions and Explanations

Considering that practical problems always contain many complex factors, first of

all, we

need to make reasonable assumptions to simplify the model, and each hypoth-

esis is closely followed by its corresponding explanation:

Assumption 1: We divide the types of lighting fixtures used in the market into LED,

fluorescent, and other lighting fixtures.

Explanation: The spectra and energy efficiency of LED and fluorescent
lamps are significantly different from those of other lighting fixtures
on the market. To simplify the model, we categorize the main types of
lighting fixtures into LED, fluorescent, and other lighting fixtures.


[PAGE 5]
Team # 2307336 Page 5 of 24

Assumption 2: We assume that the indicators that we have not selected in the eval-
uation model have a small impact on the system.
Explanation: There are too many factors that affect light pollution to
consider, so this assumption is reasonable and helps to avoid unneces-
sary trouble when building the model.

Assumption 3: During the research period of the strategy model, variables such as
population density, species richness, vegetation coverage, and the
luminous efficiency of various lighting fixtures in different regions
and cities remain relatively stable.

Explanation: These variables may experience some fluctuation, but to
simplify the model, we ignore these small changes.

Assumption 4: We assume that the four selected regions are representative enough,
so the weight coefficients of the evaluation model that we estab-
lished in previous research can be applied to any location in the
world for risk assessment. Explanation:The four regions we selected
have typical urban, suburban, rural, and protected area characteris-
tics. To simplify the problem and make the model applicable to any
region, the weight coefficients of the model indicators obtained from
these four regions can be considered constant.

4 Task 1: Regional Light Pollution Risk Level Metric

4.1 Problem Description and Analysis

Traditionally, people use Sky Quality Meters(SQMs) and remote sensing data to
evaluate light pollution levels in a given area. However, neither of them can provide
information about the spectral content of the light, resulting in difficulties when study-
ing the impacts of light pollution on ecosystems and wildlife, as different species may
have different sensitivities to different wavelengths of light.

We propose a method to combine the light source spectrum and light intensity to
calculate the response of the specified biological behavior to the light source spectrum,
evaluating the impacts such as plant maturation delayed or accelerated, migration pat-
terns of wildlife affected and human circadian rhythms confused.

To capture ground-level effects which light pollution has on humans, wildlife, vege-
tation, energy consumption, we take both radiance(brightness) and spectrum into con-
sideration to assess the light pollution risk through the following steps:

Step 1: Investigate sources of light pollution.

Summary

Light pollution is a new source of environmental pollution, which brings various ad-
verse effects to society, human beings, and even the whole ecosystem. Thus, we established a
broad light pollution risk assessment model and a flexible intervention strategy model to re-
duce the impact of light pollution.

Firstly, we build a risk assessment model based on GE matrix. Our team select 10 indi-
cators from social, economic and ecological&health dimensions to establish a system (Fig-
ure3). Then re-divide the indicators into artificial light damage system(DS) and requirement
system(RS).We get the weight of indicators by projection pursuit method. Next, we define
the scores of our two systems as DSI and RSI respectively. Taking DSI and RSI as the hori-
zontal and vertical coordinate axis of the GE matrix, the GE matrix can be divided into 9 re-
gions ( | ~IX) and 3 levels (A,B,C).Level A,B and C are in descending order.

Secondly, ignoring intra-regional differences, we apply our risk assessment model to
four regions in China: Chengdu (urban), Jintang(suburban), Xangfu Vil(rural), Baishuihe Na-
ture Reserve (protected). The results show that the risk levelof light pollution in Chengdu is
level B. Jintang is level C. Xingfu Vil and Baishuihe Nature Reserve are level A.

Thirdly, we establish a goal programming model for intervention strategy formulation.
We introduce priority factors P; and positive and negative bias variables (d;',d;) to imple-
ment region-specific flexible intervention strategies from three dimensions. We take the
weighted sum of the (d;", d; ) of all constraints as the objective function. Then establish the
constraint conditions through thesecondary indicators of three dimensions (equation 10).
Furthermore, we discuss three targeted intervention strategies: social, economic, and eco-
logical &health strategies. For example, social intervention strategies mainly control artifi-
cial light intensity and other actions at the social dimension. While intervention in the other
two dimensions is secondary. The specific actions of each strategy and their impact on light
pollution risk are detailed in 5.2.

Further, in order to select the most effective intervention strategy in a specific region, we
introduce Intervention Optimization Index (IOI). Based on the goal programming model,
we select the strategy corresponding to the minimum value of IOI by changing the priority
factor and adjusting the constraint conditions. We apply our intervention strategy model to
Chengdu and Jintang. The optimal strategy in Chengdu is social intervention strategy while
Jintang is economic intervention strategy. We use GE matrix to compare and analyze the
light pollution risk level and various indicators before and after intervention. The light pol-
lution risk level is increased from B to A in Chengdu, and C to B in Jintang. After interven-
tion, IOI in Chengdu and Jintang decrease by 13.4%and 11.1%.

Finally, we analyze the sensitivity and robustness of four constraint parameters of objec-
tive programming of intervention strategy. It is worth mentioning that we introduced the
MAPE index to test the robustness of our model. The results show that the MAPE of target
planning in Chengdu and Jintang is 1.5% and 3.0%. Our model is very robust.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

With the rapid development of urbanization, the global trend of using external lighting
to illuminate cities for night-time activities is on the rise. The problem of light pollution was
first raised in the 1930s by the International Astronomical Society, which believed that light
pollution was a negative effect on astronomical observation caused by outdoor lighting in cit-
ies to brighten the sky.

Internationally, light pollution is divided into three categories— white light pollution, ar-
tificial day and color light pollution. White light pollution is mainly due to the reflection of
buildings and color light pollution is mainly used in indoor entertainment. This paper only
discusses the artificial day which brought by outdoor artificial light.

The harm caused by light pollution has a great impact on human society and ecological
environment.!! With the development of cities and the continuous increase of population, the
number of lights used by private, commercial and public is increasing. People can travel, pro-
duce, trade and consume at night, which brings great economi efits to the city. However,
too much light has bad effects on people's physical and me , causing many diseases.
At the same time, people in certain occupations, such ers, often face white light pollu-
tion. That causes great harm to their eyesight. E and non-compliant use of light leads
to traffic accidents and other problems, wes rings certain economic losses to people.

Ecological light pollution has obvious influence on the behavior of organisms and popu-

Today, people's life and the normal operation of society cannot do without artificial light.
For example, street lighting makes it possible for people to travel normally and safely at night.


[PAGE 4]
Team # 2308000 Page 4 of 25
The popularization of street lighting reduces the crime rate. The negative effects of artificial
light: light pollution cannot be improved by blindly banning the use of artificial lights.
Measures should be taken to integrate the specific economic, ecological, population and other
aspects of a place. Therefore, our team build a model to identify the level of light pollution
risk in a place, propose intervention strategies, and analyze its impact.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

In order to formulate effective light pollution intervention policies, it is necessary to study
how to measure and mitigate the impact of light pollution in different places. Our team un-
dertook the following work:

@ Establish a light pollution risk level assessment model.

@ Assess the risk level of light pollution in four different regions and analyze the as-

sessment results based on the actual situation.

@ Develop three detailed intervention policies and analyze their potential impact on the

impact of light pollution.

@ Select two locations, determine the most effective intervention strategy, and study the

influence of intervention strategy on the light pollution risk level at this location.

@ Develop a one-page leaflet to promote a local light pollution intervention strategy.

1.3 Our Work

First of all, we build a system with society, economy, ecology & health which are the first
indicators. 10 factors as population density are put into the second indicators. Then we build
the artificial light damage system (DS) afd the artificial light requirement system RS. We di-
vide the secondary indicators into the two systems according to whether they belong to the
requirement or the damage; DSI and RSI scores are used to assess the light pollution risk levels
of the two systems respectively. The weights of the indicators are determined by plugging the
data of 40 countries into the PP(projection pursuit) method. Then, we combine DSI and RSI
scores with GE matrix to comprehensively assess the risk level of light pollution. We apply
our model to Chengdu, Jintang County, Xingfu Village and Baishuihe Nature Reserve in
China. The light pollution risk level of these four areas are obtained and the results were ana-
lyzed.

Then we build a light pollution intervention model. On the basis of the second indicators ,
we analyze the relationship between the second indicators and made preparations for the for-
mulation of intervention strategies. We then build a goal programming model. Our target is
to reduce light pollution, improve or maintain the existing order of social, economic and ecol-
ogy & health. Priority factors are introduced to reflect the priorities of intervention strategies.
Then, we put forward three intervention strategies: social intervention strategy, economic in-
tervention strategy, ecological and health intervention strategy. At the same time, the concrete
measures and effects of these three strategies are discussed. Based on the system established
in the first question and the actual situation, specific measures are proposed for each strategy.
We also analyze the impact of these actions on the effects of light pollution.

Further, we propose the intervention optimization index (IOI). By changing the selection
of priority factors, goal programming model is solved and the value of the IOI is calculated.


[PAGE 5]
Team #2308000 Page 5 of 25
We evaluate the effect of three intervention strategies by combining GE matrix, and then select
the optimal strategy.

Finally, we choose Chengdu and Jintang County to get the most effective strategies and
specific actions for the two regions respectively through our model. We further discuss the
impact of these strategies on risk levels.

2 Assumptions and Justifications

The risk assessmentyof light pollution and the formulation of intervention strategies
should take into account nomic, social, ecological and other factors. It is not possible to
model every possible scenario. So we make some reasonable assumptions to simplify the
model, each with a corresponding explanation:

Assumption1: A region under study is a whole unit, regardless of its internal regional
differences.

Justification1: The areas we selected for study vary greatly, but the overall characteristics
of these areas are significant. Therefore, we can ignore the differences in different places inside.
This study is a prerequisite for our in-depth study.

Assumption2: Ignore government costs and other factors when formulating strategies.

Justification2: Some factors have little influence, or ignoring some factors can simplify
the model.

Assumption3: Assume that the mathematical relationship between secondary indica-
tors is independent of each other.

Justification3: Facilitate the establishment of models and the proposal of strategies.

The assessment of the risk level of light pollution is an important prerequisite to propose
intervention strategies for light pollution in a specific area; According to relevant literature

sively consider the endogenous correlation between: light pollution and these above factors.
Then we extract 3 primary indexes and 10 secondary indexes, and preliminarily establish the
light pollution risk system as shown in the figure 3.

In addition, we do not considérmany redundant factors, which will eliminate unneces-
sary obstacles for the subsequent model optimization, thus conducive to the subsequent anal-
ysis of index mechanism.

Summary Sheet

Evaluation and Optimization of Light Pollution
Based on EWM-TOPSIS

In order to alleviate the more and more serious light pollution phenomenon, this paper will
analyze the issues related to the evaluation of light pollution risk levels and light pollution
treatment by establishing mathematical models.

For problem 1, firstly, a hierarchical interactive evaluation index system with 7 factors that
impact the risk level of regional light pollution is established in this paper. After that, an
Evaluation Model of Light Pollution Risk Level is established based on this. A combination of
the Entropy Weighting Method and TOPSIS is used to evaluate the selected specific locations
that aim to formulate the metrics of light pollution risk level.

For problem 2, In order to visually reflect the light pollution risk levels of the four types of
locations, this paper takes Shaanxi Province, China, as the research area, and utilizes ArcGIS
geographic information software to calculate the geometric shape centers of the plots and extract
the data of each index. On this basis, the constructed light pollution risk level model is applied to
measure the light pollution level of the four types of locations and produce a map of light
pollution risk distribution in Shaanxi Province in 2022. The ,esults showed that urban
communities, represented by Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, had the highest light pollution risk level of
0.407. Light pollution risk scores in protected land, rural and suburban communities were 1.1%,
6.8%, and 68.6% of urban communities, respectively,

For problem 3, this paper proposes three light “pollution treatment strategies and
quantitatively analyzes the impact of the three Irght pollution treatment strategies on each light
pollution risk level evaluation index. In this ways a Light Pollution Treatment Optimization
Model is constructed to optimize the*evaluation indexes that affect the light pollution risk level.
Lastly, the potential impact of light pollution treatment is analyzed by combining the optimized
light pollution risk values.

For problem 4, nature reserves and urban communities are selected for evaluation among
four types of sites, and the optimization model of light pollution treatment is applied to analyze
the effectiveness of three light pollution treatment strategies for these two sites. To determine the
optimal improvement strategies for the evaluation sites in the short-term (0-10 years), medium-
term (11-35 years), and long-term (36-50 years), respectively, this paper uses Logistic equations
to predict the population data and also combines the predicted values of other factors by Arima
time series method for the optimized light pollution score calculation. Comparing the risk levels
before and after optimization, the results show that the optimal strategies for urban communities
in the short-term, interim, and long-term are the strategies of raising residents’ awareness of
light pollution treatment, the strategies of regulating market standards, and the strategies of
establishing a sound social monitoring mechanism, respectively; while in the next 50 years, the
effects of the three optimal strategies on the treatment of protected land are not obvious, because
the light pollution risk level in protected land itself is low and not easily influenced by external
factors. For urban communities, crime rates increased by an average of 2.140%, and traffic
accident rates decreased by an average of 2.135% in areas following light pollution treatment.

Finally, based on the results of solving the above mathematical model, we make flyers to
advertise light pollution treatment measures in urban communities represented by Xi'an, China.

1 Introduction

To enable reasonable modeling, this section will introduce the phenomenon of light
pollution and the proper nouns involved in the paper. It will also sort out and evaluate the issue
that the subject necessitates solving.

1.1 Background
1.1.1 Light Pollution

According to reference [1], light pollution, also known as light damage, is an ecologically
damaging phenomenon caused by the excessive use of artificial light as humans enter industrial
society. Light pollution is a by-product of industrial development, mainly from home lighting,
industrial lighting, recreational activities, sports field lighting, etc. Its common forms include
light trespass, over-illumination (e.g. Figure 1) and light clutter (e.g. Figure 2).

Figure 1 The City of Lights (https://baike.sogou.com) Figure 2 Colorful city lights (https://baike.sogou.com)

Light trespass is the phenomenon of artificial’ light covering the natural state of dark areas,
while over-illumination refers to the use of light’intenSity higher than the required level, thereby
creating light interference in the surrounding’ afea phenomenon. These two phenomena are
correlated in a certain way, meaning that over-illumination will cause light trespass at the same
moment. Light clutter is a light.pollution phenomenon which is caused by an excess of light
wavelength and color blending.

The main countries sefiously affected by light pollution are developed countries like Japan
and the United States, as well as in developed areas of developing countries like China. Light
pollution may cause human sleep deprivation, stress, disruption of plant and animal growth
rhythms ,and other hazards, which can be mitigated by taking measures to improve lighting
systems, laws, and regulatory systems.

1.1.2 Sunshade

Sunshade is a type of architectural design that, by rerouting light and altering its path,
lowers the dangers of sunlight and light pollution. It is frequently used in tall houses made of

glass curtain materials in urban areas [2]. Sunshades can be categorized into two categories:
vertical sunshades and horizontal sunshades. Figures 3 and 4 above illustrate the corresponding
operating principles for each category.

The incident shading area and the reflected shading area are created on the glass curtain
wall by the sunshade, which significantly lowers the glass curtain wall's reflective area, as can be
seen from the principle of the above figures [2]. Through the simultaneous use of vertical and
horizontal sunshades, the light can also be reflected to the ground or light-absorbing materials,
effectively reducing the light pollution brought on by secondary reflection of artificial light.

1.2 Restatement of the Problem

Light pollution can have a negative impact on people's daily lives and the ecosystem. This
paper integrates various factors to evaluate the effects of light pollution in various locations and
suggests some steps that can mitigate the effects of light pollution in an effort to increase
people's awareness of the effects of light pollution. The following are the particular problems
that need to be solved:

1. Establish an evaluation model that can assess the risk level of light pollution at any location by
taking into account the population, biodiversity, geographical conditions, climatic conditions,
and degree of development of the area.

2. The light pollution risk level evaluation model is applied to evaluate the light pollution risk
levels of the four types of locations involved in the question, and the reasons for the
evaluation results are analyzed.

3. Propose strategies to the light pollution issue and analyze the effects of each optimization
strategy's measure on light pollution as: well as the potential impacts of light pollution
improvement on society.

4. Two sites were selected from the four types of sites to determine the optimal light pollution
management strategy for each. Invaddition, the impact of each strategy on the light pollution
phenomenon is quantified, aiid’the causes of the various impacts are analyzed.

5. Make a flyer for local distribution to publicize light pollution measures in a particular location.

2 Our Approach

Combining the requirements of problem and relevant background information, through data
collection, processing and analysis, the approach in this paper is as follows.
> Measurement of light pollution risk
1. Establishment of light pollution risk evaluation model

A hierarchical interactive evaluation index system based on the categorization of light
pollution phenomena will be established as the foundation for further scoring in response to the
specifications stated in question 1. The entropy weight method is then used cyclically to compute
the factors in the evaluation index system in a stratified fashion and determine their weights
based on the samples of data that have been gathered. The specified locations are scored using
the TOPSIS evaluation model in combination with the weights determined by the entropy
weight method after standardizing and normalizing the various types of data. The scoring
outcomes and established light pollution rating criteria can then be used to calculate the risk of
light pollution at the designated location.
2. Establishment of light pollution risk measurement application model

In order to solve problem 2,this paper will first divide the land in the study area into the four
land types specified by the question, using Shaanxi Province, China, as an example. Following
that, ArcGIS software will compute the geometric shape centers of the divided land parcels using
the WGS1984 projection coordinate system. The extracted value tool was used to extract each


[PAGE 5]
Team # 2312411 Page 5 of 25

category of index's raster data to its associated shape-center points, whereupon the light pollution
risk evaluation model was used to determine the shape-center light pollution risk score. Lastly,
the light pollution risk value for this type of site is calculated using the average of the scores at
the geometric center of the same type of site, eliminating individual differences and improving
measurement accuracy.
> Optimization of light pollution problems
3. Establishment of light pollution treatment optimization model

For problem 3, this paper incorporates the causes of light pollution and the objects they
affect in order to develop three optimization strategies from both subjective and objective aspects,
each of which includes a mix of mandatory and soft requirements. The impact is then
quantified into the evaluation index system established by model | based on the predetermined
measures, and the optimized factor values are then scored again using the Entropy Weight
Method-TOPSIS evaluation model to determine the li

Summary Sheet

Local Light Pollution Analysis: A Multi-layer Evaluation Model
Summary

Light pollution is a growing concern for many communities and ecosystems around the world.
In order to measure the level of light pollution in a region, this paper develops a Light Pollution
System Model, which reflects the risk of light pollution in a region by selecting several relevant
indicators. For four different regions, our Light Pollution System Model provides a good represen-
tation of their main characteristics, which makes it easy to propose targeted policies.

First, we identified four primary indicators: traffic, ecology, energy and society, and set several
secondary indicators under each primary indicator to form the Light Pollution System Model.
Finally, the entropy weighting method was used to determine the weights and establish the associ-
ation between each indicator and the risk of light pollution.

Next, we used K-means clustering algorithm to divide the collected data into four classes
and summarize the data distribution of indicators in four regions: Protected Land, Rural Commu-
nity, Suburban Community and Urban Community. The clustering centers of the four classes were
used as the data representatives of the four regions. Then, the datarof the four regions were evalu-
ated in the evaluation model, and the light pollution scores weré calculated as Protected Land:0.053,
Rural Community:0.174, Suburban Community:0.359, and Urban Com-munity:0.872. Urban com-
munity has the highest level of light pollution. Finally, the light pollution of each of the four regions
was analyzed by the scores of the minor indicators.

To identify three possible intervention strategies, we used the top 10% of each region as the
ideal vision, compared it with the regional average, and identified strategies focused on one or two
main targets for each strategy to reduce light pollution levels. We then quantified the impact of
each strategy on the target uSing a scale, which was classified as high (20%-50%), medium (10%-
20%), and low (2%-10%). Finally, three feasible strategies were obtained: green infrastructure
strategy (around ecology indicators), energy strategy (around energy indicators), and urban plan-
ning strategy (around traffic and social indicators).

Finally, we used the urban area of Tosca, Italy, and the suburb of Latsia, in Cyprus, as appli-
cation targets. The three strategies we designed were substituted to calculate the minimum and
maximum possible impact on the area. The effects of the three strategies were compared and we
obtained that energy strategy were the most suitable strategy for the urban area of Tosca, with
light pollution coefficient LPR reduction levels: 4.8%-11.65%, while the urban planning strat-
egy was the most suitable strategy for the suburban area of Latsia, with light pollution coefficient
LPR reduction levels: 3.26%-7.51%. Then we analyzed the impact of the strategies on the small
indicators and summarized the reasons for the impact areas of these two strategies from a detailed
perspective. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the Light Pollution System Model
proposed in this paper, and the results show that the model performs as expected in practice, prov-
ing that the proposed model is reliable.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem Background

Light pollution is a growing concern for many communities and ecosystems around the world. It is
caused by the excessive or inappropriate use of artificial light, which can negatively affect the environ-
ment as well as the health and safety of humans and other organisms. For example, light pollution can
disrupt the migratory patterns of birds, causing them to become disoriented and confused. Exposure to
artificial light at night can disrupt human circadian rhythms, leading to poor sleep quality and associated
health risks, such as obesity and diabetes.

The impact of light pollution varies depending on local development levels, population, biodiversity,
geography and climate. To effectively address light pollution, it is important to develop a widely appli-
cable measurement model and discuss intervention strategies that can be tailored to different regions.
1.2 Restatement of the Problem

Considering the background information and restricted conditions identified in the problem state-

ment, we need to solve the following problems:

@ Problem 1: Create a measurement model that can be widely applied to identify the level of risk
for light pollution in a given location. |

@ Problem 2: Use the measurement model to assess the leyel-ofrisk for light pollution in four
different locations with diverse characteristics: a protectedland area, a rural community, a sub-
urban community, and an urban community.

@ Problem 3: Explain three potential intervention strategies that could be used to address light
pollution and describe specific actions thatcould be taken to implement each strategy. Discuss
the potential impact of each strategy in mitigating the negative effects of light pollution.

@ Problem 4: Select two locations for assessment using measurement models and determine the
most effective interyentiom sttategy for each location. The results of the model were analyzed
and the selected interyention strategies were determined to reduce the light pollution risk level
at each site.

@ Problem 5: For one of the locations that was assessed using the measurement model, and for
which an effective intervention strategy was identified, create a one-page flyer to promote the
strategy for the location.

1.3 Our Work

Because of the weakness of research in this area, we should study this problem further. The schematic
diagram of our study is shown in Figure 1. First, an evaluation model with four main indicators and nine
sub-indicators was developed, and the Entropy Weight Method was used to confirm the weights of all
indicators by collecting relevant data from several authoritative data sites. Then, the k-Means clustering
algorithm was used to summarize the distribution of indicators in the four regions and to find a repre-
sentative value for each region. The data were also analyzed by substituting them into the evaluation
model. In order to give an appropriate strategy, the top 10% of the best data for each region was used as
the ideal vision, which was compared with the average data of the region as a whole to find the focus of
the strategy.

Combining the weakness analysis and existing research, we propose three strategies with feasibility.
To facilitate the impact assessment later, we quantified the degree of impact of each strategy on the indi-
cator using a ranking. Finally, we explore the application of the strategies to the urban area of Tosca in

Italy and to the suburb of Latsia in Cyprus, analyzing the optimal strategy and the impact of the optimal
strategy on the different indicators in the area.

2 Assumptions and Justifications or
Assumption: The average lighting luminosity indict th pollution risk assessment index se-
lected in this paper is the nighttime luminosity. y

Justification: Light pollution caused by lighting mainly comes from street lights and LED adver-
tising signs in commercial gathering tight [5], daytime lighting is negligible, the main way to
limit light pollution is to limit the Ry eSs of lights at night.
Assumption: The brightness of treet lights, LED billboards and other light-emitting equipment in use
at night remains unchanged, A Fl the degree of light pollution generated by the use process.

Justification: Lighting devices such as LED lamps will remain at a fixed power during normal
operation, with negligible variations, and are therefore considered to cause a fixed level of light pollution.
Assumption: The level of light pollution in rural areas, suburban areas, conservation areas and urban
areas is not affected by geographical location such as latitude, longitude and altitude.

Justification: Weather conditions are stochastic and cannot be predicted, so to simplify the model,
the light pollution evaluation model proposed in this paper ignores these effects.

4.1.1 Traffic

According to the study, the degree of traffic development in the region has an important influence
on local light pollution [1], and the main sources of artificial light on traffic roads are lights caused by
illuminated street lamps and passing vehicles, as well as reflections generated by the road surface. With
the rapid development of cities and surrounding areas, the scale of traffic roads has also expanded, and
in nature reserves and rural areas there are mostly main roads running through them, so the degree of
traffic development is selected as a first-order indicator to measure the risk of regional light pollution.

In for nighttime artificial light remote sensing image analysis shows [1], according to the road clas-
sification, different levels of roads present different artificial light intensity because different levels of
roads have different lighting needs and characteristics. For example, highways and major roads may
require brighter lighting, which will result in the generation of more artificial light, while residential
streets require less lighting and generate less artificial light.

Major light pollution is generated from primary, secondary and tertiary roads and is influenced by
road density [1], and the effects of light pollution from other classes of roads are ignored in this paper.
Therefore, the equation for the response of regional traffic development to the light pollution risk factor
is defined as:

TRA = (bo + biys + boYy2 + bg y3) X e%” (3)

TRA is the degree of response of traffic development to lightspollution. Yi, Ye, Y3 denote the
number of primary, secondary, and tertiary roads in the area, respectively. by is a constant term. The

“On the earth, even in the darkest night, the light never wholly abandons his rule.“

Jules Verne, Journey to the Center of the Earth.
Summary

With the rapid development of modern technology and excessive use of artificial lights, light
pollution has resulted in increasingly severe problems. Therefore, the proper design and implementation
of intervention strategies to address these problems deserve our attention. This report aims to build
a light pollution risk level evaluating model and provide credible suggestions on how to effectively
reduce the negative impacts of light pollution.

Three models are established: Model I: Ecologic-Social-Ecologic(ESE) Model; Model II: Light
Pollution Risk Assessment(LPRA) Model and Model III: Interconnected-ESE Model(I-ESE) Model.

For ESE Model (Model I), we first abstract the risk of light pollution into three subsystems :
Economic, Social and Ecological Subsystem and construct the ESE model. For economic subsystem,
we calculate the population growth by the logistics equation and measute the light pollution in economic
systems. For social subsystem, we take five types of land togetherswith the brightness threshold into
account and obtain the proportion of light-pollution-affected land. For ecological subsystem, we set a
formula with the number of organisms together withJightantensity value to calculate the number of
affected organisms.

For LPRA Model(Model ID), we use Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) based on Google search
index to quantify the light pollution riskylevel(RL) of a certain region, then apply our model to 284
regions. After that, we use K-means“algorithm to create a metric system for the risk levels and
constructed four ranks: Slight(0:0443°~ 0.1678), Moderate(0.1705 ~ 0.2542), Serious(0.2568 ~
0.3698), and Severe(0.3976 ~ 0.6186). To apply our model to specific locations, we selected Ordos as
protected land, Zhaotong asrural community, Qingyuan as suburban community, and Guangzhou
as the urban community and obtained their RL scores: 0.1332, 0.1778, 0.2574 and 0.5154, while
their risk levels are slight, moderate, serious and severe respectively.

For I-ESE Model(Model III), by establishing a link between every two subsystems, we constructed
the Interconnected (I)-ESE Model on the basis of the ESE Model, and obtain quantitative relationships
between HCL and SCL, EC'L and EN L using nonlinear fitting. Based on I-ESE Model, we propose
three effective intervention strategies to address the light situation: I. Reduce light intensity, II. Reduce
the impact on society, and III. Delimit dark night protection areas and their actions correspondingly.

More specifically, we select Guangzhou and Zhaotong for further discussion and determine their
optimal strategy: strategy I and II for Guangzhou and strategy II and III for Zhaotong. Then we
measure the impacts of these strategies in general and particularly in Guangzhou and Zhaotong using
I-ESE Model and visualize the impact with GE cube. The risk level in Guangzhou decreased from
0.5153 to 0.0309 while Zhaotong decreased from 0.1678 to 0.0885 after 20 years of implementing the
optimal strategy.

Finally, the sensitivity and robustness of our model are tested. When we set the cost to be raw
data, increase or reduce by 50%, the overall trend of risk level has little difference as the curve remains
similar, verifying the sensitivity and robustness of our model.

1.1 Problem Background

Estimates suggest that more than one-tenth of the planet’s land area experiences artificial light at
night - and that rises to 23% if skyglow is included. [I] Artificial lights have revolutionized the way
humans live their day-to-day lives, resulting in increasingly severe problems along with their benefits.
More than ever, human and environmental health is suffering from this boom of artificial lighting.
Unfortunately, we are now faced with what scientists call “light pollution”, which poses a great threat
to the ecosystem, economy and our society in several aspects.

To tackle this problem, the methodology to measure the influence of light pollution in a certain
location, as well as the design of a proper intervention strategy deserve our attention. Some major cities
have been aware of the seriousness of light pollution and take the lead in the exploration of governance,
but problems regarding lack of legal basis and public awareness have been revealed. Challenged
by ICM, we decide to build a model to evaluate light pollution as well as determine corresponding
intervention strategies.

1.2 Problem Restatement & Our Work

Considering the background information and restricted¢onditions identified, we need to take several
measures to solve the following problems:

Problem Restatement: Develop a metric to identify and evaluate the light pollution risk level
of a certain location.

Our work: We first abstract the riskeof light pollution into three subsystems, and calculated the
light pollution risks concerfing economic, social and ecological subsystems.

Problem Restatement; Apply our metric to four diverse types of locations: a protected land
location, a rural community, a suburban community and an urban community.

Our work: Using AHP based on google search index, we quantify the light pollution risk level
of a certain region. Then, we selected Ordos, Zhaotong, Qingyuan and Guangzhou for further
discussions.

Problem Restatement: Describe three possible intervention strategies and their corresponding
actions and their potential impacts on light pollution.

- Our work: We propose three effective intervention strategies in three different aspects and
their specific actions correspondingly. To evaluate the impact of these strategies, we obtain the
quantitative relationships between risk levels in different aspects.

Problem Restatement: Choose two of our locations and determine the most effective interven-
tion strategy in certain locations, as well as their impacts specifically.

Our work: We choose Guangzhou and Zhaotong to determine their optimal strategy through
I-ESE Model and evaluated their impacts in GE cube.

2 Assumptions and Justification Ms

gaa

¢ Assumptions: The population density isms remains stable and constant.

- Justifications: The tality maintains stability because natural disasters are infrequent

while the birth and mortality are typically similar.
¢ Assumptions: They ru structure of primary, secondary and tertiary industries remains
unchanged.

- Justifications: As the economy of the locations we study are well-developed, the industrial
upgrading of these nations is practically complete, thus the changes in proportions of primary,
secondary, and tertiary industries are negligible.

¢ Assumptions: The application of artificial light in agricultural production is not considered

- Justifications: Compared with those in the secondary industry and tertiary industry, artificial
lights in agriculture are not widely used. Thus, the proportion of artificial light used in primary
industry is relatively small, and the negative impacts are negligible.

¢ Assumptions: When considering the scoring in our LPRA model, only the selected area is
considered, without considering its internal influence and the interaction between regions.

- Justifications: As all aspects of risk level are not reflected by a certain indicator only, it can be
the result of many factors working together.

4 Establishing the ESE Model

Light pollution is the presence of unwanted, inappropriate, or ex¢essive artificial lighting.[2)] Too
much light pollution washes out the view of the universe, increasing energy consumption, interfering
with astronomical research, disrupts ecosystems while affeeting the health and safety of both humans
and wildlife. Thus, we must evaluate the risk of these,different aspects we’re currently facing because
of light pollution.

Based on research by National Geographie{3j], the main effects of light pollution can be broken
down into three aspects, thus we identify, the light pollution risk level in Economic System, Social
System and Ecological System respectively. Then, we can establish our light pollution risk evaluation
model: Economic-Social-Ecological System Model, we shall call it ESE Model in the following
paper for short. To this endyour ESE Model is the combination of three submodels, which will be
introduced respectively in the following paragraph, both shown in Figure

Figure 2: Breakdown of light pollution risk

4.1 Pre-processing of lighting data

Data preprocessing is a way of converting this raw data into a much-desired form so that useful
information can be derived from it, which is fed into our model in evaluating the light pollution risk

level in a certain area. We obtain data on grayscale values of the original impact of nighttime lighting
(DN) from LPSTI[8]], then we eliminate DN values that are less than zero. Then, we radio-metrically
correct the nightlight data for the area, the radiation correction equation is as follows:

L = DN3 x 10719 (1)

where L represents the corrected radiation brightness value and DN represents the original grayscale
value.

4.2 Evaluation in economic subsystem

Light pollution generates significant costs, which in the U.S. amounts to nearly 7 billion dollars
annually. [4] To evaluate the risk level regarding light pollution in the economic system, we consider
the phenomenon of the accumulation of population in an economic system. As the economic system
is a complicated, interrelated system, an initial impact on the population will lead to an exponentially
higher consequential impact on risk levels. Inspired by a population dynamics method [5], we formulate
the N as a logistic growth function in the following Equation

dN N. :

— =rxN x (1 —abm)e' 2
dt | (1 aero ”)
where N represents the population in a certain location and N,,, represents the maximization of the
population. r represents the natural growth-fate of the population. Then we can solve the logistic
equation by separating variables, integrating and rearranging to get the analytical solution of the N

value:
Nm

(42 —l1)e*+1

When considering the compositional structure in an economic system, industries are categorized into
primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. We reasonably assume that the ratio of the three industries
remains unchanged during the research period. After calculating the projected value of population
growth, we can define the total amount of light pollution produced in the economic system(EC) by
the following Equation Af

M(t) = (3)

3
EC = 5_—N x PC; x PLP, x tm; (4)
i=1
where PC; represents the proportion of primary, secondary and tertiary industries in an economic
system respectively and PLP; represents the light pollution per capita in primary, secondary and
tertiary industries. tm, represents the length of time that the industry uses artificial light.

Based on data from UN Data[9]], we visualized the data on the total population and population
growth rate in the past decade in the world, where: WRL represents world data, LMC represents
low-middle income countries, UMC represents middle-high income countries and HIC represents
high-income countries, shown in Figure 3} Then, Figure4] shows the percentage of primary, secondary
and tertiary industries respectively. It can be easily concluded that during the past decade, the proportion
of different economic sectors remains unchanged, which reflects the rationality of our assumption.
