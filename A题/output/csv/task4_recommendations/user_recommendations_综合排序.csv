1,R5,Enable dark mode (OLED screens),0.84,10.5,10.0,1,9.34,"0.4×(10.5/28.0) + 0.3×(10.0/10.0) + 0.3×(10-1)/10",P_screen,Eq.(3): P_screen OLED specific,OLED black pixels consume zero power,Samsung_OLED_Power_Study_2023,"Zero cost: OS-level toggle. Effectiveness varies by content (all-white: 0%, all-black: 30%). Avg gain 10.5% assumes 70% dark UI coverage."
2,R1,Reduce screen brightness to 50%,1.4,17.5,9.8,2,8.95,"0.4×(17.5/28.0) + 0.3×(9.8/10.0) + 0.3×(10-2)/10",P_screen,Eq.(3): P_screen in P_total sum,Screen is typically 30-50% of total power,AnTuTu_Display_Power_2024,"Highest single-action gain. Brightness: Linear power scaling (100%→50% = -40% power). Adaptive brightness mitigates UX cost."
3,R2,Use WiFi instead of 4G/5G when available,0.38,4.8,9.5,1,6.89,"0.4×(4.8/28.0) + 0.3×(9.5/10.0) + 0.3×(10-1)/10",P_network,Eq.(5): P_network = P_wifi + P_cellular,WiFi consumes ~40% less than cellular,Qualcomm_Radio_Power_2023,"Auto-switching: OS can prioritize WiFi. 4G: 250-400mW vs. WiFi: 150-200mW. 5G SA mode: 500-700mW (worst case)."
4,R8,Use power saving mode proactively at 30%,2.24,28.0,8.8,5,8.66,"0.4×(28.0/28.0) + 0.3×(8.8/10.0) + 0.3×(10-5)/10",P_total,Eq.(1): Overall P_total reduction,Power mode reduces aggregate consumption,Android_BatterySaver_Whitepaper,"Largest TTE gain but high UX cost (CPU throttled, background restricted). Best at <30% SOC. Reduces P_total by 35% (CPU -15%, screen -10%, network -10%)."
5,R6,Lower screen refresh rate to 60Hz,0.56,7.0,8.7,2,6.30,"0.4×(7.0/28.0) + 0.3×(8.7/10.0) + 0.3×(10-2)/10",P_screen,Eq.(3): P_screen refresh rate component,120Hz uses ~20% more display power,DisplayMate_RefreshRate_2024,"120Hz→60Hz: -15% screen power. Gaming UX impact high, but static content unaffected. Adaptive refresh (LTPO) optimal."
6,R3,Disable GPS when not navigating,0.4,5.0,8.5,2,5.81,"0.4×(5.0/28.0) + 0.3×(8.5/10.0) + 0.3×(10-2)/10",P_gps,Eq.(6): P_GPS term,GPS is high-drain (~200mW active),Broadcom_GPS_DataSheet,"GPS: 150-250mW active. But many apps request location in background. System-level permission control critical."
7,R7,Disable auto-sync for non-essential apps,0.24,3.0,8.3,2,4.85,"0.4×(3.0/28.0) + 0.3×(8.3/10.0) + 0.3×(10-2)/10",P_network,Eq.(5): Background sync overhead,Periodic sync keeps radios active,Android_JobScheduler_Logs,"Sync: Wakes radio every 15-30min. Each wake: 5s @ 300mW = 0.42mWh. Daily: ~20mWh. Marginal but cumulative."
8,R4,Close unused background apps,0.24,3.0,6.3,5,3.69,"0.4×(3.0/28.0) + 0.3×(6.3/10.0) + 0.3×(10-5)/10",P_cpu,Eq.(4): P_processor scaling,Background tasks add 10-20% CPU load,ARM_CPU_Governor_Study,"Low practicality: Android aggressive killer already active. Manual kill: Temporary (apps restart). Better: Uninstall bloatware."
