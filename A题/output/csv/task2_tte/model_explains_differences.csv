S3_Gaming vs S1_Idle,-40.0,P_cpu/gpu term (0.6W vs 0.05W),dSOC/dt = -[P_screen + P_cpu + ...]/(V*Q),GPU-intensive rendering increases CPU power 12x; background tasks (physics engine) add 1.3W,CPU/GPU (60% of total power),High (S1_cpu = 0.35)
S4_Navigation vs S1_Idle,-38.0,P_gps term (0.35W vs 0W),P_gps = P_gps_base * gps_activity_factor,Continuous GPS fix requires 0.35W; screen at high brightness for visibility,GPS + Screen (62% combined),Medium-High (S1_gps = 0.22)
S5_Video vs S2_Browsing,-2.0,P_screen vs P_network trade-off,"P_screen = f(brightness, display_size)",Video has higher screen power but lower CPU usage; network similar (streaming vs browsing),Screen brightness (50% vs 44%),Low (difference in model parameters is small)
WiFi vs 4G (same activity),3.5,P_network = f(connection_type),"P_network = P_base * network_type_factor (WiFi=0.15W, 4G=0.35W)",4G radio requires 2x power due to cellular tower communication overhead,Network type (20% TTE impact),Medium (S1_network = 0.15)
Temperature effect (25°C vs 40°C),-5.2,E2 temperature coupling: Q_eff = Q * f_temp(T),f_temp(T) = exp(-k_temp * |T - 25|^1.5),Li-ion efficiency drops at high temp; internal resistance increases,Temperature (f_temp = 0.92 at 40°C),Medium (E2 contribution ~8%)
New battery vs Aged (500 cycles),-8.0,E3 aging: Q(n) = Q0 * exp(-k * n^0.5),SEI growth + Li plating reduces Q_eff by 15% at 500 cycles,Capacity fade from SEI layer growth; SOH drops to ~85%,Aging (E3 contribution ~15%),High for aged batteries (S1_age = 0.28)
