I1,CPU_Load,Temperature,Multiplicative,P_cpu(L,T) = P_cpu_base × L × (1 + k_thermal × (T-25)),0.023,Thermal throttling: High CPU → Heat generation → Increased resistance → Power reduction feedback loop,0.341,0.407,±8.5%,S3_Gaming,Thermal_Coupling_Eq9_Extended,At T>35°C & CPU>70%: System throttles CPU frequency by 15-25% to prevent overheating. Paradoxically EXTENDS TTE (+8.5%) but degrades UX. Model captures via temperature-dependent CPU efficiency η(T).
I2,Screen_Brightness,Ambient_Light,Adaptive,P_screen(B,A) = P_screen_base × B × (1 + k_ambient × log(A_outdoor/A_indoor)),0.035,Auto-brightness: Outdoor (1000 lux) requires 40% higher brightness than indoor (300 lux) for same perceived luminance,0.178,0.213,±6.2%,S2_Browsing,Ambient_Light_Sensor_Logs,Outdoor use: Ambient light 1000-10000 lux forces screen to 80-100% brightness (vs. indoor 30-50%). Model uses Weber-Fechner law: Perceived brightness ∝ log(stimulus). Impact: -6.2% TTE outdoors.
I3,Network_Mode,Signal_Strength,Conditional,P_network(M,S) = P_wifi × δ_wifi + P_cellular × (1 + k_signal × (1-S)^2) × δ_cellular,0.85,Weak signal retry: 4G/5G power scales quadratically with signal loss. WiFi unaffected (short range),0.031,0.109,±12.8%,S4_Navigation,"Signal_Strength_RSS_Logs,Qualcomm_Radio_Power","Weak 4G signal (<-100dBm): Retry overhead increases P_network from 300mW → 540mW (+80%). Model: P_network ∝ (1-S)^2 where S=[0,1] normalized signal. WiFi immune due to <50m range. Outdoor navigation most affected."
I4,GPS_Active,Network_Mode,Synergistic,P_total_gps = P_gps_base + P_network_sync × δ_4G/5G,0.45,GPS data upload: Location data transmitted via cellular (WiFi unavailable outdoors). Combined drain: GPS 200mW + Upload 150mW,0.089,0.134,±5.3%,S4_Navigation,Broadcom_GPS_+ Qualcomm_Radio,GPS without network: 200mW. GPS + 4G sync: 350mW (+75%). Synergy: Navigation apps upload location every 5-10s. Model adds P_network_sync term when GPS active. Recommendation: Cache maps (offline mode) saves 43% combined power.
I5,Video_Resolution,Network_Bandwidth,Cascading,P_video(R,BW) = P_decoder(R) + P_network × (R/BW) × δ_streaming,0.62,Adaptive bitrate: Low bandwidth (BW<5Mbps) forces resolution downgrade. Lower resolution → Less CPU (hardware decoder) → Less network (smaller packets). Triple benefit.,0.124,0.167,±9.1%,S5_Video,YouTube_ABR_Algorithm_Analysis,"4K video + WiFi 50Mbps: P_decoder=250mW, P_network=150mW. 1080p + 4G 10Mbps: P_decoder=180mW, P_network=400mW. Counter-intuitive: Lower resolution on slow network INCREASES total power (+40mW) due to network overhead dominating decoder savings."
I6,Background_Apps,Screen_Off,State-Dependent,P_background(N,Screen) = N × P_app_base × (1 + k_screenoff × δ_off),0.18,Doze mode: Android enters aggressive power saving when screen off >5min. Background apps throttled by 80%. But wakelock-holding apps bypass this.,0.067,0.095,±3.8%,S1_Idle,Android_Doze_Mode_Logs,Screen on: 10 background apps = 10×15mW = 150mW. Screen off >5min: Doze mode reduces to 10×3mW = 30mW (-80%). But messengers with wakelock: Still 15mW each. Model uses binary δ_doze multiplier. Recommendation: Uninstall wakelock abusers (identified via BetterBatteryStats).
I7,Fast_Charging,Temperature,Accelerating_Aging,Q_fade_rate(C_rate,T) = k_aging_base × C_rate^1.5 × exp(E_a/k_B × (1/T - 1/298)),0.034,SEI growth: Fast charging (>1C) at high temp (T>30°C) quadratically accelerates solid-electrolyte-interphase layer growth on anode. Permanent capacity loss.,0.247,0.289,N/A (Long-term),Battery_Aging,E3_Aging_Extension_Arrhenius,Fast charge at 40°C: Aging rate 3.2× faster than slow charge at 25°C. Model: Aging ∝ C_rate^1.5 × Arrhenius(T). Not immediate TTE impact but reduces Q_max over cycles. At 500 cycles: Q_fade = 25% (fast+hot) vs. 15% (slow+cool). Recommendation: Charge <80% + avoid charging in hot cars.
I8,App_Category,User_Age,Behavioral,P_usage_pattern(Category,Age) = P_base + Σ(P_app_i × usage_time_i × demographic_weight),N/A,Demographic usage: Young users (18-25): Gaming 3h/day.
