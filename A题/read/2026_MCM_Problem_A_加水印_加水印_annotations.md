必须有一个明确的、可解释的连续时间数学模型（continuous-time model）作为核心骨架。
数据只能用来 支持模型参数估计或验证模型合理性

只画出SOC随时间下降的曲线❌ 没有模型；→ 不满足要求的方程，使用私有数据（如自己手机测的数据）未公开❌ 若用自测数据，需上传至GitHub等平台，并注明链接；
用LSTM预测SOC，但没写任何微分方程❌ 黑箱模型

如何理解可实践性：

对比现有方案如：“相比当前‘定时关机’策略，本建议通过实时负载预测，节能效率提高23%”

提出分级策略：“轻度用户：仅优化亮度；重度用户：启用全栈节能模式”

考虑用户体验：“避免频繁弹窗提醒，采用渐进式提示（如图标变灰）”

推广到其他设备本框架可迁移至智能手表、平板等便携设备，只需调整参数”

用户能不能做？ → 能（比如调亮度）
做了有没有用？ → 有用（比如多用30分钟）
别人能不能用？ → 能（通用性）
能不能证明？ → 能（用模型或数据支撑）

如何评定这里的最大程度？
模型输出中进行定量分析与排序？
1.基于功耗敏感性分析---“降低屏幕亮度 是对功耗影响最大的单一操作，其敏感度最高。”

2.模拟不同场景下的续航延长效果。 考虑综合成本与可行性（实际最大价值）“最大改进” 不仅指节能最多，还应结合 模型量化结果、现实可行性、用户体验 综合判定。

3.在本题中，降低屏幕亮度 是物理上节能最强的操作，而 关闭后台任务 是实践中最易推广的方案。

智能手机 是一种集成了通信模块（如射频收发器）、计算核心（CPU/GPU）、存储单元、传感器阵列（加速度计、陀螺仪等）、显示系统及电源管理系统的便携式电子设备。

能量转换过程：电能 → 机械能（振动）、光能（屏幕）、热能（发热）、电磁波（通信）。

系统边界：由电池、处理器、屏幕、通信模块等组成，构成一个封闭的能量流系统。

状态变量：包括 CPU 负载、屏幕亮度、网络活动状态、GPS 是否开启等。

输入输出：
输入：用户指令、网络数据包、传感器信号
输出：显示内容、声音、通信信号、热量
```

测量边界：通常指整机功耗（含所有子系统），也可拆解为子系统级（如 CPU、GPU、屏幕）

是否包含热损失？ 是 —— 所有非有用功都转化为热能（焦耳热），属于损耗项。

功耗定义为设备从电池中提取电能的速率，单位为瓦特（W）。

在本模型中，我们将功耗视为时间的函数，并假设其由各子系统功耗线性叠加而成。”

处理器负载是指在某一时刻，处理器执行任务所占用的计算资源比例，反映其工作强度。

它是一个 无量纲的归一化指标，取值范围为 [0,1]，其中：0：空闲状态（无任务）
1：满负荷运行（持续使用最大性能）


是否包括 GPU？ 通常不包括，除非特别说明。建议明确：“本文中的处理器负载仅指 CPU 核心的综合负载。”

如何获取？ 实际中可通过 top 命令、Android 的 dumpsys 或专用工具（如 Perfetto）获得。

SOC 不等于剩余续航时间！它是 能量状态指标，不是时间预测。

非线性关系：锂电池的电压-SOC 曲线呈非线性，尤其在低 SOC 区域变化剧烈。

受温度、老化、充放电历史影响：真实 SOC 需结合 卡尔曼滤波 或 安时积分法 估算。

这不是一个物理量，而是一个 预测性指标，依赖于当前功耗模式。

关键问题：当前功耗是否代表未来？若用户行为突变（如打开游戏），预测会失效。

因此，“剩余电量”是 基于当前负载的短期预测，具有不确定性。
