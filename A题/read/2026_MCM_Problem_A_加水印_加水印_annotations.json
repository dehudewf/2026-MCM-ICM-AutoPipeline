On some days a phone may last the whole day; on other days it drains rapidly \nbefore lunch. Although some users attribute this to “heavy use,” the true drivers of battery  \ndepletion are more complex. Power  consumption  depends on the interplay of screen size and \nbrightness, processor  load, network activity, and background applications that continue drawing \nenergy even when the device appears idle. Environmental conditions such as temperature further \ncomplicate  matters:  some  batteries  lose effective  capacity  in cold weather  and may overheat\nunder sustained heavy use. A battery’s  behavior  is also influenced  by its history  and how it has \nbeen charged during its lifetime. \nYour task is to develop a continuous -time mathematical model  of a smartphone’s battery that \nreturns the state of charge  (SOC)  as a function of time  under realistic usage conditions. This \nwill be used to  predict the remaining time -to-empty  under different conditions. You should \nassume that the phone has a lithium -ion battery.  \n \nRequirements:  \n1. Continuous -Time Model: Develop a model to  represent the state of charge using a \n \n continuous-time equation or system of equations. You may want to begin with the \nsimplest reasonable description of battery drain and then extend it to incorporate \nadditional contributors such as screen usage, processor load, network connections, GPS \nusage, and other background tasks. \nData as support, not substitute: You may collect or use data for parameter estimation \nand validation. If open datasets are limited, you may use published measurements or \nspecifications (with proper citation), provided parameters are clearly justified and \nvalidated for plausibility.  However, projects based solely on discrete curve fitting, time-\nstep regression, or black -box machine learning without an explicit continuous -time \nmodel will not satisfy this problem’s requirements.
